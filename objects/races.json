A planar scion might pass for a member of the humanoid parent’s species, or the scion’s otherworldly features could make their origin obvious to those who are familiar with the species’ normal characteristics.

The Radiant Cathedral, on the other hand, trains aasimars to become beacons of the Sarenite faith, and also guides tieflings to a brighter future than their heritage suggests.

These artificial beings are humanoid in appearance and most often resemble humans made of metal, with bluish energy visible from within their bodies. Amrantahs can easily modify their bodies with access to a ghost forge, and many take full advantage of this fact. Some take on appearances resembling draconic or bestial humanoids, while others adopt a blankfaced, enigmatic appearance. Amrantahs often choose a gender fitting the soul’s identity. These amrantahs shape their bodies to reffect their gender, while others experiment with or reject gendered traits.",
        "All amrantahs emerge from the ghost forges with the default imprint left behind by the machines’ Gap-shattered programming. Originally meant to grant the amrantah a portion of their people’s knowledge, this process instead causes amrantahs to emerge with naive, innocent, and somewhat undeveloped personalities, though each is still influenced by their preimprint personalities. Amrantahs tend toward chaotic good or chaotic neutral alignment as a result, with a whimsical, fun-loving bent. Amrantahs and gnomes get along very well.",
        "Amrantah culture, such as it is, is largely defined by their environment. The pleasure-cities of Amran offer amrantahs an endless array of distractions, and many have short attention spans, though engrossing tasks can hold them rapt for as long as necessary. Even when away from their cities, amrantahs use their internal systems to play games or otherwise entertain themselves while performing other tasks. Accustomed to having their way, amrantahs can become petulant when a desire is denied, though most are too good natured to really make a fuss—another pleasure is around the corner, after all.",
        "Given their origins, amrantahs have a casual relationship with religion. When an amrantah dies, regardless of their distance from a ghost forge, the soul travels back to be reborn. While this offers immortality of a sort, the amrantahs no longer have the mastery of magitech necessary to reprogram the ghost forges. Thus, souls reborn this way are inevitably reimprinted, emerging with a blank mind and personality. Most amrantahs have a healthy respect for death, if not quite the same fear other species possess. Most amrantahs see the process of reincarnation as the doorway to new adventures, so after living a full life, an amrantah sees death as little to fear.",

They have little in the way of their own culture and strive to find their place in the galaxy.",
        "An astrazoan in their native form resembles a seven-limbed, human-sized starfish, with a single visual sensor in the middle of each limb. Their skeleton is cartilaginous and their flesh jellylike, but an astrazoan can spontaneously mold and introduce pigment into their flesh to imitate the appearance of almost any creature of the same size. Astrazoans are capable of forming both male and female reproductive organs and thus are effectively hermaphrodites. Because most astrazoans live in humanoid societies with defined gender roles, it is common for them to develop a fixed gender identity, but just as many are gender-fluid.",
        "There are very few astrazoans in the Pact Worlds (though no one can be certain of the exact number), and the majority of them reside on Absalom Station, Castrovel, Verces, and other areas where they can blend in with the local populace. They do so not for any sinister reason or even from fear, but out of a desire to make those whom they live among more comfortable. They are aware that their natural form might be a bit off putting to humanoids who primarily interact with only other humanoids.",
        "On a hunch, a team of researchers recently compared the DNA of an astrazoan volunteer to samples from an ancient race known as ilee, who vanished from their home on Apostae during the Gap, and found a remarkable number of similarities. The ilee were known for being unique: no two of them looked alike. These researchers theorize that some of the ilee used highly advanced genetic engineering to completely transform themselves in response to an extinction-level threat; the astrazoans’ innate ability to control their forms is thought to be a side effect of this change, though some believe it was the intended purpose."

With rolling hills covered in stubby grasslike protrusions and very few bodies of water, Hibb held little of interest for explorers. The moon’s lack of natural resources and the pervasive stench that issued from the ground, which no manner of filtration could suppress, further contributed to Hibb not being colonized by the barathus— or anyone else in the Pact Worlds, for that matter.",
        "However, less than 5 years ago, previously unnoticed machinery under Hibb’s surface began to stir. All across the moon, apertures opened in the ground, from which rose tall towers with spiraling ramps. Heretofore unknown creatures emerged from these towers, their small visual sensors adjusting to the light of the distant sun. The members of this sentient species, who call themselves bantrids, had slumbered in stasis for eons before their ancient computers woke them. Because of the Gap and faulty data-storage drives, however, the bantrids had no knowledge of the solar system’s current political climate and no recollection of why their people entered stasis in the first place. Some believe they were hiding from an imminent threat or natural disaster, while others posit that bantrids were the first sentient species in the system and that they put themselves to sleep to wait for others to interact with.",
        "Bantrids have unusual anatomy. Their lower halves are nothing more than dense organic spheres. Bantrids move by spinning these foot-orbs using hundreds of thousands of cilia on the underside of partial sheaths that cover the orbs. Their upper torsos are stout columns that taper slightly at the top. Bantrids have no heads in the fashion most humanoids do. Instead, their visual and auditory sensors are located in the middle of their torsos, directly under small mouths containing a few teeth made only for chewing fruits and nuts. Bantrids have no noses and, in fact, no sense of smell at all. Near the apex of their torsos, bantrids have a pair of appendages that resemble large, flat hands with several thin fingers. Bantrids’ skin often bears striped coloration along the length of their torsos and across their upper limbs.",
        "Most bantrids are curious about the “new” galaxy they now find themselves in and are eager to learn about all the other sentient species that inhabit it. This leads them to rush (sometimes literally) into situations before fully understanding them. Some of their Pact Worlds neighbors find this trait endearing and happily bring bantrids into their businesses or starship crews, while a few others are put off by their appearance. Bantrids don’t hesitate to write off those who don’t accept them, and they easily move on to new opportunities.",
        "Bantrid culture revolves around motion, from their ramped tower-dwellings to their treadmill-chairs. A bantrid who isn’t moving starts to feel an overwhelming dread akin to claustrophobia. If this lasts too long, the bantrid will simply leave wherever they are at the moment, despite the social consequences. A restrained bantrid will keen wildly and hyperventilate, usually passing out.",
        "Bantrids have no gender and reproduce via a form of budding that creates tiny bantrids whose foot-orbs are not yet sufficiently developed to allow locomotion. These offspring must be carefully watched over until they can move on their own, which takes about 5 months."

        "Barathus are the sentient apex of Bretheda’s gas-giant ecosystem, blimp-like creatures vaguely reminiscent of jellyfish, with several unusual evolutionary adaptations. The first is their ability to rewrite their own genetic code instinctively and at will, adjusting their own biology to allow them to manufacture a huge array of substances—and even advanced biotechnology— within the crucibles of their own bodies. Yet while this ability makes them quite successful in the Pact Worlds economy, and has deeply influenced their culture’s understanding of wealth and trade, their more notable adaptation is the ability to combine with others of their kind into larger, hive-minded superentities. These mergings create not merely amalgams of their component beings, but entirely new entities with unique and independent consciousnesses, yet which in turn often disband back into their component individuals after a particular need or threat has passed.",
        "Barathu culture tends to be easygoing but hard for some other races to understand, as the barathus’ frequent merging makes the concept of “self” somewhat nebulous to them. Young barathus who grow up surrounded by humanoids are an exception, as they are better able to appreciate the mindsets of creatures who exist in static, solitary configurations. Compared to older barathus, early stage barathus are more adventurous and individualistic, and their adaptation to the humanoid mindset makes it more difficult for them to merge completely with others of their kind. Most of these early stage barathus grow out of this phase, gaining the ability to fully integrate with others, yet recent generations have seen more and more barathus deliberately clinging to their juvenile mindsets. While plenty of barathus remain discrete entities for most of their lives, barathus nearing the ends of their lives often merge with massive, permanent combinatory entities that serve as corporations, governments, or cultural repositories."

        "Bolidas are arthropodan creatures that dwell not on the faces of the planets they inhabit, but far underground, in cave systems that are so deep below the surface that they are blasted by the unforgiving heat of the planets’ molten cores. The centipede-like creatures are protected from these extreme environs by metallic, chitinous plates that cover the entirety of their backs, from head to tail tip. This innate armor also protects them from subterranean hazards such as rock falls and the friction of traveling through cramped cave tunnels. Bolidas support themselves on their many sets of legs, holding only the uppermost portion of their bodies upright to wield weapons or manipulate objects. They have evolved over millions of years to thrive in darkness, and they therefore tend to avoid traveling up to the surface world; if they choose to live on a planet’s surface or a space station, they prefer to maintain nocturnal schedules, as sunlight blinds them if they’re not wearing protective eyewear.",
        "Only a few decades ago, a group of offworld explorers on the bolidas’ home planet, Zafaiga, first encountered the modest miners while quarrying the unique stones that they assumed had no claimant. Though the bolidas were territorial, wary, and somewhat xenophobic, it was overall an amicable, if tense, meeting. Afterward, the bolidas reluctantly agreed to establish a mutually beneficial relationship with other species, contracting trade agreements and eventually even adopting Common into their lexicon. Though the broader galaxy has known of their existence for only a few decades, bolidas have been extant for millennia, unconcerned with and largely unaware of the outside world. They independently developed their own technology (though it is predominantly analog and therefore considered primitive by some races), which they use to dig for resources and excavate cavernous dwellings. Even those bolidas who travel the galaxy tend to be rather aloof, blowing off attempts at personal friendships by members of surface races, whom they dismiss as capricious “light dwellers.” They choose instead to spend their time alone, with other bolidas, or with members of subterranean races with whom they can share their passion for excavation.",
        "Digging is a euphoric activity for bolidas, and they spend a large portion of their lives creating new tunnels and caves to house their ever-expanding populations. New settlements can grow from a single small cave to hundreds of miles of mazelike tunnels and dozens of vast caverns in mere months. Because of this natural disposition, bolidas have proven themselves to be indispensable in the acquisition and trade of rare minerals. Their ability to thrive in the heat deep underground on moltencore planets means they are often hired as miners by individuals and organizations all across the galaxy to excavate subterranean dig sites that most other races are unable to withstand.",
        "Bolidas exhibit no discernible sexual dimorphism or gender, and each bolida is capable of carrying and fertilizing eggs—oftentimes they will take on both roles. They also sometimes mate in groups, covering the floors of their nursery caves with eggs that are incubated by the heat of the depths. The average bolida is 7 feet long and weighs 350 pounds."

Some borais are the results of partially botched resurrection attempts, either magical or technological, while others were people who were simply too stubborn to fully die when their time came.",

Borais still need to eat, breathe, and sleep, just like any living creature, but they age at radically slowed rates, allowing them to live for a few additional centuries. After that length of time, a borai’s physical body deteriorates to such a degree that the soul can no longer sustain it; the borai then both dies (as living creatures do) and is destroyed (as undead creatures are). Scholars are divided as to whether these souls move on to their appointed afterlives or simply dissipate into nothingness; mystical attempts to contact these souls have unfortunately failed, leaving researchers frustrated in their pursuit of answers.",

Those who come into existence elsewhere tend to migrate to Eox, as they are often viewed with fear and mistrust on other worlds. However, they soon find that similar prejudices await them on the dead planet, as they still require the same comforts as living creatures. A few borais from disparate former races have banded into a small coalition to petition the Pact Council for the official rights to an asteroid or small moon to create a home planet.",

A few borais attempt to hide their pale appearances with cosmetics and full-body clothing. These borais attempt to blend in with members of their original races, though this often results in heartbreak and feelings of betrayal from their friends."

These 5-foot-tall mammalian humanoids resemble otters, though they have slightly longer legs that allow them to walk upright. Brenneris are particularly adept at detecting subtle physical and emotional reactions. This makes them especially skilled at understanding the emotions of others, and they are naturally talented diplomats.",
        "When brenneris developed space travel sometime before the Gap, they enthusiastically began making expeditions from their home world to nearby planets in hopes of learning from their galactic neighbors. They quickly found that their empathetic nature allowed them favorable interactions, even with typically aggressive species. The brenneris began to intentionally hone this skill into diplomacy, and once they developed Drift travel, they were welcomed with open arms at Absalom Station and in the Pact Worlds at large. Now, a significant number of brenneris sell their skills as diplomats to other species that require ambassadors or that would prefer for brenneris to act on their behalf.",

Most other species allow brenneri to work as duos, even in cases where only a single representative would normally acts on behalf of a particular group, such as intergalactic senates.

To help manage these moods, most brenneris keep a small token to help them calm their emotions and focus their minds on the task at hand. This can range from a simple object, such as a small stone, to more personal items, such as an image of a lover or a childhood relic. A brenneri might even keep multiple items that they favor, choosing a specific object to suit a given situation.",

This usually happens when they meet individuals who express great joy, excitement, or some other positive emotion about a profession, calling, or experience. A brenneri’s emotional insight can then kick into overdrive, causing them to decide to pursue a similar experience themselves. It’s not uncommon for a brenneri to meet a spacefarer who’s just returned from an exhilarating adventure and then quickly want to become an adventurer themself. Brenneris find themselves especially taken with enthusiastic shirrens, and many become early adopters of new technologies and lifestyles.",
        "Though brenneris’ natural empathy for the emotional journeys of others usually serves them well, it can sometimes bring them into conflict with others. They might, for example, compulsively attempt to intervene as councilor or intermediary in cases where the involved parties aren’t interested in outside interference—and others may find brenneris’ well-meaning attempts to help condescending or intrusive. It’s not uncommon to hear tales about brenneri companions who were “too helpful,” insisting on trying to assist someone in a rough emotional state even after being declined repeatedly. In some circles, this has earned the species a reputation for nosiness, though even then, few would consider a brenneri’s interest malicious."

These moguls have purchased large swaths of the planet’s real estate, ruling as silent overlords of ghost towns and thriving neighborhoods alike.",
        "Although contemplatives are known to be extraordinarily intelligent, observant, and confident, their behavior is often jarring to their colleagues of other species. Individual contemplatives often refer to groups of their kindred using the first-person plural, suggesting some degree of racial hivemind, telepathic union, or sacred sense of shared existence. Further supporting this theory is the fact that contemplatives rarely come into conflict with one another, with few instances of intraracial violence in recorded history. Despite contemplatives’ relative peacefulness, other races often perceive them as aloof, overly logical, and emotionally sterile.",
        "Contemplatives are able to speak, though their voices are reedy and soft. Most consider verbal communication rather crude, favoring telepathy. Those who regularly need to speak often wear inexpensive contact speakers that translate their telepathic thoughts into spoken words. They’re also able to sing in keening wails, although they rarely do so except around others of their kind or their most honored colleagues. The few ethnographers who study this behavior directly have compared the songs to religious paeans—an association contemplatives find absurd, in part because most prefer to study faith objectively rather than as worshipers.",
        "Despite their frail appearance, contemplatives are able to survive in unforgiving environments. They find indoor sites far more comfortable, however especially areas that are cool and still, as these conditions facilitate their concentration. When contemplatives do build their own communities, the structures are often windowless and difficult to navigate for those unable to fly."

        "The people known throughout the galaxy as damais are survivors of a shattered planet who are at once hardy yet fragile, savvy yet foolish, prescient yet solipsistic. Their planet is ancient even on the scale of the vast universe, and yet for damais, modern history is merely 200 years old. Life on Daimalko, their dry, rocky planet in Near Space, transformed when an event called the Awakening wracked the land with earthquakes, evaporated the world’s oceans, and withered its greenery. Worse, the cataclysm awakened the terrible colossi at the heart of the people’s legends. Some of these monstrosities were",
        "kyokors",
        ", though many were other, equally horrific beasts, and all rose from their slumber beneath the seabed to destroy most of the planet’s inhabitants in short order.",
        "Prior to this disaster, the people of Daimalko were split between two advanced, warring societies: the holy Queendom of Ykarth, which claimed a divine mandate from the empyreal lord Duellona, and the psychic Confederation of Volkaria. But the Awakening drove most of the surviving damais underground, regardless of their allegiance, where they huddled in caverns they came to collectively call the Refuge. Nearly 150 years passed as the remaining damais and their descendants grappled with the cultural trauma of the Awakening. Originally a fragile people threaded with natural ribbons of psychic energy, empathic magic, or braids of both, damais adapted into the hardy and resourceful people they are today.",
        "About 50 years ago, a wise leader in one of the deepest and largest pockets of the Refuge resolved to reunite damais for good. Reirali Kokolu sought to build solidarity among the refugees despite the fact that the colossi still rampaged on the surface above. At great personal risk, she traversed the lightless caverns to make contact with other refugee settlements, inviting their leaders to travel with her until they’d contacted each surviving damai and formulated a plan to keep them connected to one another, even if only spiritually.",
        "Near the end of the leaders’ journey, they stumbled upon a curious cache of rune-scribed orbs. Though most of the leaders thought the objects mere baubles, useless remnants of the planet’s lost civilizations, Reirali Kokolu felt compelled to commune with the orbs. At first, touching them conveyed blasts of overwhelming emotion, fits of magical hubris, unnatural physical strength, and the darkest dread. However, after studying them at length—and convincing the other damai leaders to do the same—Kokolu found that the orbs, when bonded to a user, subtly conveyed vital information about the marauding colossi, such as their physical locations at any given time. Users of these orbs even seemed able to subtly influence the beasts’ behavior, though doing so caused tremendous stress, both mentally and physically. Communing with the orbs also fused the leaders to each other emotionally. As they learned to wield the orbs’ power, the leaders came to realize that with just a little concentration, they could inhabit each others’ minds and hearts.",
        "These damai leaders became the first Guardians. Invigorated with the powers they’d unlocked, the Guardians returned to their respective settlements in the Refuge. Some died mysteriously along the way, and to this day it is unclear why, despite numerous attempts to discover the fates of these Guardians and any motive or meaning behind their deaths.",
        "However, the rest returned to their enclaves. While some used the orbs merely to fortify their settlements, terrified of the power of the colossi they felt through their artifacts, other Guardians began ushering small colonies of damais aboveground, carefully using their bonded orbs to shield their people from harm. Now, the underground settlements have approached a stability that is just shy of thriving, though the aboveground colonies still struggle, thanks both to their youth and to colossi attacks that their Guardians have failed to thwart. Daimalkan Guardians command great power, found both within them and through their orbs, but they are no less mortal than their kin, who age much as humans do. Thus, each Guardian carefully chooses and trains her successor over about a dozen years, using her wits, her wisdom, and her bonded orb, which she transfers to her charge when the time is right.",
        "Though some whisper that the magic flowing through the leaders is somehow tied to the force that sparked the Awakening, trust in the Guardians is nearly universal in damai settlements. Despite their different approaches to survival, the Guardians and everyday damais recognize how deeply tied to each other they are—or without the bonds of their people, damais would have nothing except the colossi that slaver for their end.",

Members of this faith don’t actively set out to destroy, but they do very little to prevent and reverse natural deterioration. They build only items that speed up this decay, mostly by using negative energy. This pseudoreligion is widespread throughout the Confederacy, and many races native to the nebula count themselves as followers, receiving the Eye of Enlightenment during a ritualistic process involving special inks distilled from dark energies. Many who get this tattoo gain powers similar to solarians who focus on the graviton aspects of their cycle.",

To them, their path is a stately and dignified march toward the inevitable and ordained end of all things, while the Devourer’s followers cheapen the entire experience and ruin the work of generations by thrashing around in childlike tantrums, attempting to tear reality’s fabric instead of embracing its beautiful unraveling.",

Draeliks encased in shining armor and fighting for the betterment of every race and creed are rare, and those who seek to shatter the mold must always contend with their inner demons, sometimes even struggling against foul temptations from sceaduinars who want to bring them back into the fold."

        "Native to Triaxus, dragonkin are smaller and more humanoid than their true dragon cousins, yet more intelligent than brutish drakes and wyverns. Even before the advent of the Gap, dragonkin had a long history of alliance with humanoids, specifically in a region on Triaxus called the Skyfire Mandate, where many dragonkin carried ryphorian riders into battle against the armies of the evil dragons in the Drakelands. With the formation of the Pact, however, the Drakelands’ masters ramped back their cruelty to ostensibly legal levels; these dragons eschewed their expansionist wars in favor of biased laws, secret police forces, and corporate oligarchies. In the wake of this peace and the dawn of easily accessible space travel, the Skyfire Mandate’s famed Dragon Legion was renamed the Skyfire Legion and found a new purpose as a spacefaring mercenary league that protects innocent colony worlds that are beyond the reach of the Pact’s laws. Yet not all dragonkin and their bonded partners signed up to join the legendary militia’s new crusade, and some instead took to the stars independently to find their own fortunes.",
        "Probably the greatest distinguishing feature of the dragonkin is their near-magical ability to bond with a non-dragonkin partner, traditionally a ryphorian. Living and working together— and often training to complement each other in combat—a dragonkin and his partner can develop such a deep bond that they begin to literally read each other’s thoughts, allowing them to act with perfect synchronization. On Triaxus, this historically resulted in bonded pairs known as dragonrider pairs: a humanoid partner riding into combat on the dragonkin’s back and providing ranged and magical support. While there are still plenty of planet-dwelling pairs who practice this ancient form of combat, today, a dragonkin and his partner more often use their link to make an exceptional starship crew or ground assault squad. The bond between dragonkin and partner goes far beyond simple combat, however. While generally not romantically involved with each other, dragonkin and their partners act in sync in nearly every aspect of their lives and form an inseparable partnership that outside relationships must accommodate.",
        "Life among the stars has led to variation within the dragonkin race, both culturally and genetically. While dragonkin adopted the use of armor, weapons, and other tools millennia ago, this reliance has accelerated dramatically in recent centuries. Dragonkin who remain on Triaxus and live according to tradition retain their abilities, yet those who make their homes in the cramped quarters of ships and space stations have a diminished ability to fly—a fact that drives a wedge between traditionalists and the newer breed, the latter of which claim that a good starship provides the only wings they need.",
        "Dragonkin tend to be intimidatingly stoic to strangers but loyal and fun with their friends. While the Skyfire Legion has an unusually heroic code of ethics for a mercenary unit, dragonkin in general are no more good or evil than humans, finding their own religious or moral codes or simply doing whatever it takes to protect their friends and families. While legionaries don’t like to admit it, many dragonkin (and even their humanoid partners) are perfectly happy working for the chromatic-run corporations on Triaxus, conducting shady operations and making sure humanoids in the Drakelands remain properly cowed. Dragonkin have a particularly complicated relationship with the vesk, as the normally aggressive reptilian race have ancient religious scriptures claiming that the spirits of the Veskarium’s greatest warriors would be reincarnated elsewhere in a form suspiciously similar to the dragonkin, and thus vesk have always treated dragonkin with respect and deference, even when their two systems were at war.",

        "Dromadas are members of a bipedal mammalian species from the Near Space planet Dromaritia that average 5 feet tall and weigh around 200 pounds. Their powerful unguligrade legs end in long, hooved toes, while their shorter forelimbs include strong dewclaws and fingers that allow the manipulation of tools. Long necks end in drooped heads, atop which stubby eyestalks allow their eyes to move independently, giving dromadas a wide field of vision. They have soft, fine fur that can be various shades of red or brown.",
        "Having spent most of their history as the most populous and preferred prey animal for their home world’s numerous large carnivores, the dromadas’ presapient ancestors formed tightly knit herds to keep safe. The skittish creatures reacted to danger first by emitting a deep moan that would alert the entire herd, then bolt for safety in huge stampedes. As they gradually learned to use tools, communicate with spoken language, and develop more advanced technology, dromadas retained these behaviors, which continue to serve them well even as they join the galactic community. While dromadas are a sapient species and as such are not considered food to most other sapient species, there are a few evil species willing to go to great lengths to obtain dromada meat, which is reported to have a unique and savory flavor.",
        "Dromadas usually operate in large family units and rarely do anything individually. The herbivorous creatures prefer open spaces large enough for an entire group and with good visibility, especially when eating. Half the group eats while the other half keeps watch, with the groups switching roles so everyone gets to graze. Dromada homes are usually large, single-story buildings with plenty of exits that can accommodate an entire herd. The floors of such structures are often used to grow the grasses they feed on so that the dromadas can spend their free time grouped together grazing in the safety of their homes. Dromada herds can be large enough to staff entire corporations, where employees live and work together in large compounds with open floor plans. Such enterprises can be found in a staggering array of industries, providing products and services that range from plant-based meat substitutes to social media consultancy.",
        "In their youth, dromadas train in specific skill sets so they can provide a variety of services to the herd as adults. Members of dromada society place great importance on their responsibilities; the more the herd can provide for itself, the less it needs to depend upon potentially dangerous outsiders. When dromadas become curious about the outside world, they travel short distances from the herd in small groups called huddles. When confronted with anything they perceive as dangerous, members of the huddle flee to the safety of the herd and warn others about what they encountered. Smaller groups of dromadas living permanently in densely populated, cosmopolitan urban areas continue this trend, and frequently rely heavily on delivery services, ensuring no one has to leave the herd to obtain supplies.",
        "Dromadas do not consider leadership of a dromada herd to be an honor or something to aspire to, as leaders become targets simply by virtue of their position. Most dromada herds elect their leaders democratically and for limited terms, but because an average dromada has no interest in taking on a leadership role, the herd itself nominates candidates for political office—whether an individual wants to run or not. Rather than focusing on their own achievements, many candidates instead highlight the accomplishments of their opponents in hopes of losing the election to someone else. Crime within dromada society is rare, as the punishment can be exile—a sentence akin to death for their distant ancestors. In truth, modern dromadas feel much the same way about this punishment, as most dromadas dread the prospect of being without their herd. Dromadas can nonetheless find themselves alone, whether because they were exiled, they were the sole survivors of an attack, or they were left behind due to sickness or injury. Such dromadas instinctively look for a surrogate herd to join as soon as possible. A dromada’s trust is very difficult to earn, as they view everything around them as potentially dangerous and can be extremely skittish, but they are loyal and constant companions to those who eventually gain their friendship. As a result, individual dromadas can form strong bonds with members of other species, especially those with a similar generalized fear of danger, such as the sluglike osharus (Starfinder Alien Archive 2 92).",
        "Dromada adventurers or mercenaries are extremely rare, as dromadas who choose such paths would need to overcome their powerful instincts to flee when in danger. But when they are able to, dromadas make excellent lookouts, first responders, and even bodyguards, using their powerful legs for lightning-fast repositioning in the heat of battle. Their fearful natures also mean that most modern dromadas have some talent configuring and bypassing security systems and devices. Still, choosing an adventurer’s life isn’t easy, as even the bravest dromadas still sometimes find themselves automatically fleeing from dangers, both real and imagined."

Dwarves trace their heritage to the missing planet of Golarion, yet for them, this is not merely a matter of history, but identity—they were forged in the furnace of Golarion’s subterranean passages, and many dwarves born long after the planet’s disappearance still feel the sting of its loss, kept alive in dwarven song and legend. Dwarven history also claims that they once had a different racial god, Torag, who left his worshipers in the hands of his brother Angradd during the Gap so he could stand guard over Golarion, wherever it is now.",

Many dwarves are attracted to asteroid mining, with Star Citadels common in the Diaspora.",

This traditionalism sometimes causes other races to see dwarves as old fashioned, or even backward. Dwarves are certainly cautious in adopting new technologies and slow to change their way of life, but once a new technology has proven safe and effective, it’s quickly adapted to dwarven needs. Dwarves are often mechanics, mystics, and soldiers. They tend to get along best with gnomes, halflings, humans, and other races with ties to Golarion, though they have a sometimes impolite appreciation for androids’ elegant construction and find much in common with kasathas and korasha lashuntas.",

Embri consider eating a private, embarrassing function, and they are repulsed at how openly and communally other races eat.",
        "Culturally, embri long ago mastered social conditioning to eliminate all displays of emotion; they consider expressiveness to be barbaric, and the occasional embri who shows feelings openly is considered primitive and dangerous. As a side effect of keeping their own feelings in check, embri easily pick up on signs of emotions. To prevent inadvertent displays of emotion, embri wear ornate masks. These masks also denote social standing, civic responsibilities, and other designators that allow embri to immediately assess one another by sight. Embri wear their masks at all times, even when sleeping, and to be without a mask is a profound embarrassment—it evidences a gross exposure of an embri’s thoughts and feelings, rendering it unable to effectively protect its own emotions and too distracted to effectively read the expressions of others.",
        "Few embri realize their rigid social hierarchy is controlled by the forces of Hell—scheming devils direct all embri activities from the secret tunnels beneath the mollusks’ home world. These dictates are conveyed by the small group of embri, known as Speakers, who communicate with the devils directly and enact their infernal designs. In exchange for this service, Speakers are granted magical powers and the secrets of diabolical manipulation. Some Speakers also serve as diplomats and envoys from the embri to the Pact Worlds. In these roles, they both shield their people from dangerously individualistic thinking and extend their masters’ designs to the rest of the galaxy. Speakers usually travel with a coterie of devoted embri servants who, in their uniquely expressionless way, idolize the Speaker as a celebrity.",
        "The diabolic taint on embri society is pervasive, yet subtle. For example, the embri language now contains several Infernal words and phrases, and though embri shun symbols of deific obedience as an overemotional expression of connection to the divine, stylized iconography of infernal origin features prominently in modern embri architecture."

        "The avian espraksas originated from the Near Space planet of Neeroon. A small, frigid planetoid at the farthest reaches of its star system, Neeroon is a rugged world with a variety of biomes, from taigas to rocky badlands, and sky-scraping mountains to ice-filled canyons. The coloration of espraksas varies depending on the environment in which their ancestors evolved. Espraksas who adapted to the taigas of Neeroon developed deep-brown or russet feathers, while those who live in the snowy peaks have white or gray feathers lightly speckled with black or a mossy green. Espraksas have a thick collar of feathers to keep their long, slender necks warm. They also have lengthy antennae-like feathers that extend from the inner corners of their eyes. Males have crests of feathers that extend from the crowns of their heads and are expressive enough to communicate emotion. Espraksas stand about 7 feet tall and weigh 175 pounds.",
        "Espraksas consider themselves the offspring of the deities Desna and Weydan, unified in a pairing called the Wings. Their open, sociable, and free-spirited society reflects this origin story. Though the rule of law is important to espraksas, the application of wisdom and compassion is equally so. Espraksa settlements often have shrines dedicated to the Wings.",
        "Espraksa settlements also emphasize harmony with nature. They avoid razing the environment to make way for their settlements, instead incorporating their towns and homes high up in the surrounding trees and terrain. This architecture has left few means for land-bound creatures to enter from the ground. As tourism to Neeroon has grown more common, the espraksas have had to accommodate flightless creatures.",
        "Wanderlust and gregariousness are intrinsic to espraksa society on Neeroon despite individual regions having many quirks, which it seems their peoples took pains to preserve. Espraksas revel in exploration, whether literal, interpersonal, or spiritual. They often embark on a journey of self-discovery in an unofficial coming-of-age ceremony, traveling the galaxy and immersing themselves in other cultures. Espraksas love to make friends, even with the surliest of folk, establishing positive emotional connections that are passionate and enduring. Most espraksas can proudly recollect every friend made on their journeys and find enemies only under extreme circumstances. However, once an espraksa has decided another creature is a foe, the hostility can be just as fervent and lasting.",
        "Due to their exposure to many cultures and fields, espraksas fill many vocations. They take whatever odd jobs are available to fund their ongoing adventures. Many seek occupations that facilitate exploration, from field scientists to mercenaries. Diversity in skill is a virtue among espraksas, so much so that being good at one skill at the expense of others is seen as a character flaw.",
        "An espraksa’s journey can last decades. Most return to Neeroon when they feel their travels have provided enough novelty. Then, such espraksas settle down on their icy world, find mates, and start families. Older espraksas are highly valued leaders, philosophers, and teachers, their know-how honed over a lifetime of exploration. Some elder espraksas are celebrated experts even beyond Neeroon, renowned across the galaxy for their breadth of experience."

Every aspect of ghoran physiology was designed to be perfect; unfortunately, that included “perfect taste”—their flesh-like rinds were so delicious that humans hunted them nearly to extinction. Worse, each was able to produce only one seed, adding to the precariousness of their species. Over hundreds of generations, they evolved from shambling, vine-like creatures into their current humanoid forms, but they still found themselves ostracized by humanity. While the first humans took to the stars, Golarion’s ghorans abandoned what is now the Pact Worlds to forge a new identity for their people. They discovered a planet they named Ghorus Prime and terraformed it from a barren rock to a lush floral paradise. The ghorans have flourished in this new world. Through genetic engineering, they have expanded their reproductive abilities, leading to the development of two ghoran subraces— the lithe and springy saplings and the tall and dense oaklings.",
        "Ghorans are roughly the same size as humans, and are nearly as diverse physically, though unlike humans, ghorans can adjust their bodies’ shapes within their frames’ limits. Their “skin” is a complex layer of fibrous vines and rinds with a texture like moss-covered bark, while their faces consist of hundreds of layered petals that flush and flutter at a whim.",
        "Each ghoran has a ghorus seed within its navel. As a full action, a ghoran can expel this seed. If planted in fertile soil and left undisturbed for 1d6 days, the seed grows into a sapling ghoran who physically mirrors the original. If left undisturbed for an additional 2d6 days, the seed grows into an oakling ghoran instead. After a sapling ghoran has been fully grown for 2d20 months, they can choose to grow into an oakling ghoran, a process that takes 1d6 weeks. Every 20 years or so, a ghoran develops a new seed, allowing the race to slowly grow its numbers.",
        "Many ghorans are withdrawn around flesh-and-blood creatures. They often prefer the company of vesk to humans— in fact, a popular conspiracy holds that ghorans fed information about humans to the vesk during the Silent War between the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium. Thus, ghoran-colonized planets and the Pact Worlds view each other with distrust. Despite these grounds for suspicion, ghoran society emphasizes the importance of community life, friendship, and companionship—all luxuries most ghorans could only dream of when they were few and hunted."

        "Long-ago emigrants from the primal fey realm called the First World, gnomes are a vivacious people who have adapted to their tumultuous heritage in curious ways, and evolved significantly from accounts found in pre-Gap records.",
        "Gnomes today fall into two ethnicities: feychildren and bleachlings. Easily recognized by their brightly colored skin and hair, feychildren remain physiologically and socially close to their otherworldly heritage and are intensely mercurial, possessed of wild whimsy and a ravenous, reckless appetite for adventure. Bleachlings, by contrast, are believed to be the descendants of those who survived the virulent gnome plague called the Bleaching, which to this day threatens to drain the color and life from any feychild gnomes who don’t constantly seek out enough new experiences to retain their vibrancy. Bleachlings are typically born with monochromatic features, their palettes ranging from black and white to brown and gray. While they are usually more even-tempered than their feychild cousins, Bleachlings have an exaggerated—but only half-deserved—reputation for dourness.",
        "How exactly the bleachling adaptation occurred—whether it was an intentional and experimental genetic solution to the ancient gnome disease, a freak mutation, some deific blessing, or something else entirely—has sadly been lost to the Gap, and many feychild gnome researchers desperately attempt to re-create it in corporate laboratories and magical universities. In the meantime, bleachling gnomes continue to pass their immunity on to their children and those of mixed relationships, founding a new subrace that, while still currently a minority, is poised to someday completely replace their parent race— for better or worse.",
        "Gnomes of both types usually have spindly frames and large eyes that give them a youthful (and sometimes disturbing) appearance. Both ethnicities remain extremely curious and have a passion for new experiences, yet they often take different approaches to this need for mental stimulation—while feychildren are constantly chasing new physical situations and sensations, bleachlings often find their search for novelty sated through purely intellectual pursuits. As a culture, gnomes rarely build lasting social structures among themselves or other groups. Instead, most gnomes choose to constantly pursue their whimsy and passions alone or with a few close companions. Many feychild gnomes in particular find that keeping interesting friends is a good way to stave off the apathy and eventual madness that is the Bleaching.",
        "Gnomes often find it difficult to relate to other races, as their humor and thought processes can seem wildly bizarre to those who don’t share their unique viewpoints or context. As a result, most gnomes don’t expect to be understood, and thus don’t bother to explain themselves, further widening the gap between themselves and others. Yet while they are often complex and erratic, gnomes generally have kind and generous hearts, especially when it concerns their friends. Both ethnicities tend to get along best with humans and ysoki, while finding kasatha and vesk overly stodgy, though bleachling gnomes are also commonly found in the company of lashunta scholars. Feychild gnomes make excellent fasttalking envoys, while bleachling gnomes often lean toward studious, intellectual classes like the mechanic, mystic, and technomancer. Gnomes are most often found on Absalom Station and Castrovel, though their curiosity has spread them across the Pact Worlds and beyond. Strangely, though the elves of Sovyrian are notoriously standoffish to other races, gnomes are not only tolerated but welcomed freely within their borders, supposedly in honor of some pre-Gap bargain forgotten by outsiders.",

        "Goblin legend claims that long ago, a tribe of surprisingly clever goblins stowed away on a spacecraft that left Golarion and made its way to Absalom Station, where the goblins infiltrated the station’s worst neighborhoods and set up camps in its engineering passages. Over time, the goblins learned to build weapons and armor from scavenged parts, though many of their efforts are prone to exploding at the slightest provocation. While space goblins have since managed to hijack other ships and spread to the stars, nowhere are they as prevalent as on Absalom Station—a fact for which all other worlds that are familiar with space goblins are extremely grateful.",
        "Thanks to the goblins’ rapid reproduction rate, many generations have passed since those first goblins came to Absalom Station. Fluctuating gravity, an entirely new diet, and the occasional radiation leak have made space goblins a distinct offshoot species from Golarion’s goblins. They are a bit more intelligent, instinctively able to take apart technology and rebuild it to suit their strange whims. They are quicker as well, scuttling rapidly into nearby ventilation ducts after swiping unattended datapads or laser pistols.",
        "While some space goblins still worship the goblin hero-gods of old, partially adapting their dogma to fit their current lifestyle, many more revere Triune, the machine god. Their innate aptitude for using technology (without knowing how it actually works) leads them to believe that Triune has a plan for them. Some even think it will lead them to some kind of scavenging paradise, where every dawn will bring a new piece of advanced technology to strip for parts. However, neither Triune nor its church has yet officially acknowledged these zealous space goblins.",
        "Goblins from Golarion were known for their voracious appetites, often eating their body weight each day of what passed for cuisine in the twisted mind of a goblin. Space goblins were not afforded that luxury in those early days aboard Absalom Station; they had to subsist on discarded scraps of food and other garbage. As such, space goblins aren’t as insatiable, though they are no less orally fixated. There is an even chance that upon encountering a strange item, a space goblin will try to either dismantle it or eat it. A space goblin might even attempt to diagnose a problem with a small piece of technology by putting it in his mouth and tasting every part of it.",
        "Goblins’ instinctive hatred and fear of dogs and horses has also adapted over the millennia. Space goblins tend to refer to any quadruped (or anything shaped even remotely similarly) that they dislike as a “dog” or “horse,” depending on its size. In that vein, they still refer to their iconic crude melee weapons as dogslicers; these function just like survival knives, though a few enterprising goblin tribes have discovered ways to give the blades microserrated or ultraserrated edges. Other tribes have taken to adapting flame pistols and flame rifles to suit their needs, dubbing them “horseroasters.”",
        "The physical differences between space goblins and their cousins from Golarion (none of which have been seen for centuries) are slight. Space goblins tend to be a few inches taller, and their eyes are a deeper shade of red. A typical space goblin is about 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 35 pounds—most of that weight is in the head."

The planet is rattled with earthquakes and pitted with active volcanoes, so the gosclaws used sophisticated engineering to build complex underground cities that could withstand the shifting earth around them. However, they were still centuries away from developing starfaring technology when an Azlanti scout ship crashed near a gosclaw city. The crash had no survivors. Gosclaw engineers began to study the vessel’s technology, formulating sciences of space travel and advanced weaponry based on what they found.",
        "When the Azlanti Star Empire landed its forces a few years later, the gosclaws knew they could not hope to rebuff such a technologically advanced enemy. Instead of fighting, they approached the Azlanti with an offer of service and proof of their engineering prowess with the reverse-engineered scout ship. Ever since, gosclaws have held citizenship status and served the Star Empire diligently, if not with complete loyalty. They regard the Azlanti as benefactors but consider them to be dangerous and self-serving. Most gosclaws think it far safer to avoid Azlanti notice than to attract attention. Gosclaws who leave Duren work for the Azlanti as engineers on projects where the thin, flexible gosclaw body is a benefit. However, more than one gosclaw has stowed away on a departing ship to see other worlds.",

Their fur coloration can vary considerably depending on their region of origin or the weather there, but the hue ranges from a dark, nearly black brown to a gold color, which is often darker at the tips of ears, limbs, and tail. (Gosclaws also dye their fur to express individuality.) Long centuries working underground in cramped quarters have made gosclaws well suited to such conditions. Gosclaws are also quick-witted and individualistic, focused more on achieving results than obeying procedure, a trait that can annoy Azlanti managers.",
        "Always looking forward, gosclaws see technology as a way for them to leapfrog evolution and propel themselves into the future. As such, gosclaws are far less interested in maintaining their own traditions than other species, and they view their position in the Azlanti hierarchy as desirable for advancing their culture. Although the gosclaws know the Azlanti are far from benevolent, the felines are, themselves, opportunists. They imagine a near enough future in which they are free of Azlanti influence, and so they believe their conquest at the Star Empire’s hands is a long-term advantage.",

        "No one knows what planet or even galaxy the grays call home, but reports of their unnerving abductions, nightmarish paralysis, and mysterious experiments have been collected from countless worlds for as long as starships have sailed in the dark spaces of the universe. Such reports are fragmentary and unreliable, offered by victims recounting hazy memories of enduring various procedures under clinically bright lights or waking in cramped and lightless confinement, and do little to explain the methodology or goals of their captors. Those captors, though, have much in common no matter the specific circumstances or the species of the victim: an otherworldly presence, condescending interactions, and a sinister disregard for the agency and dignity of those they take as subjects for their experiments.",

However, their goals appear to center around the search for information, rather than conquest. Victims of their paralytic abductions are almost always returned mostly unharmed, though the sudden appearance of a series of scars or an inexplicable implant undermines the effects of the grays’ ability to erase memories of the experience. Researchers wonder at the end goals of this accumulation of knowledge and what purposes the information gleaned may serve in the meantime. Some fringe scientists believe grays are preparing for an eventual all-out invasion, while others posit they are simply curious about us, but their alien mindsets lead them to sate this inquisitiveness in disturbing ways.",
        "Once rare enough that reports of their abductions were written off as conspiracy and delusion, encounters with grays have become disturbingly more common with the advent of Drift travel. Their sleek, disk-shaped starships lurk in the dark corners of the Drift, appearing seemingly out of nowhere to confront vessels with inattentive or unwary crews. Much like the grays themselves, their ships are designed less for offense and more for evading and subduing their targets, employing tractor beams and EMP weapons to disable and control a vessel, preserving its crew as test subjects. Such captives find themselves unable to move, held under brilliant lights, their captors mere silhouettes as their thoughts and memories are sifted under the gray’s psychic touch."

Combining this upward lift with web sails and occasional blasts from their gas tubes, haans are able to ride the winds of their home world with terrifying speed and precision, often bobbing along just at the leading edge of a storm front. Once they locate prey, haans ignite their jets of flammable gas using sparks from specially evolved strike plates in their leg chitin, creating biological flamethrowers. The roasted prey is then quickly caught and secured to a balloon of its own before it can fall away into the planet’s depths.",

Those rare haans who leave their kin to travel the stars often become starship and aircraft pilots, finding that their experience in flying organically on Bretheda gives them a natural aptitude for the physics involved. Sadly, these individuals are inevitably mourned as dead by their families and never allowed to return home—a fact that leads many haan starfarers to join up with crime families, megacorporations, military organizations, adventuring groups such as the Starfinder Society, or an other social organizations that promise a senses of belonging. Of late, a group of haan expatriates have begun making plans for a technology-friendly haan colony on a gas giant in Near Space, which they’ve named Haanara. Without the need for ordinary humanoid gas-mining platforms, they hope to create a highly lucrative refuge for haan workers tired of being held back by tradition, though many fear that attempts to actively recruit on Bretheda will lead to ugly sectarian violence.",

Their chitin tends toward a pinkish purple, and they have barbed limbs and spiky pedipalps, which stretch wide on either side of their faces. Though the mottled colors on their shells can be quite beautiful, haan vanity is focused almost exclusively on the large, hairlike spikes extending from the tips of their abdomen. Haans never cover these unless they absolutely have to, and they frequently carve, cut, and decorate them with the same care humans reserve for head hair. Indeed, even traditionalist haans on Bretheda often sneak onto mining settlements in search of offworlder barbers and other artisans offering “file and style” services to help them establish unique and identifiable looks."

Many half-elves are fond of wandering, with a strong desire to prove themselves, seeking out new worlds in the Vast for fame and glory or in the hope of establishing new colonies. Though their often complicated relationship with their parent races makes them natural iconoclasts, they also tend toward kindness and understanding.",
        "With their extreme versatility, half-elves are a perfect fit for nearly any profession, though in recent years an unusually large number have become operatives or soldiers for the Stewards, perhaps seeing in the enforcement of the Pact a chance to foster understanding and build a single system-wide culture that no longer strands halfelven children between two worlds.",

        "Halflings are a common race in the Pact Worlds and their colonies, having spread nearly as far as humans. Popular legend even claims that halflings were among the first humanoids to spread beyond Golarion and into the stars to colonize new worlds. Once thought of as a people without a homeland, halflings have peppered the void with colonies, and halfling caravan fleets—dozens of ships from as many different makes and eras—ply the trade lanes, eager to see new sights, swap stories, and trade strange and foreign goods. Their small stature and tendency to wander make halflings popular targets for raiders and conquerors, but time and again the tenacious race has rebounded from harsh challenges thanks to their cooperation, optimism, and what seems to be a racial gift for subterfuge.",
        "Gifted with quick reflexes, charming confidence, and an apparent lack of fear, halflings are known across the galaxy as athletes, celebrities, and explorers. Of course, this dramatic public image hardly defines the race as a whole. While most halflings experience a period of daredevil bravado in early adulthood, most settle out of it again just as quickly to become happy and loving homebodies, content with a hard day’s work and an evening spent with friends. Boasting a wide variety of eye, hair, and skin colors mirroring the human range, halflings usually have slight builds and large hands and feet. They make fast friends wherever they travel, preferring negotiation or clever wordplay to combat. Despite this accommodating nature, they have few permanent allies; halfling history is littered with long eras of domination and abuse, making them gregarious but wary of placing themselves in situations they can’t get out of again. While they share much in common with the ysoki—a love of travel and trade especially—they lack the ratfolk’s mechanical inclinations, and the two races often compete for markets, salvage rights, and trade lanes. If halflings truly ally with any race, it is humans, whose history is intimately entwined with their own, for better or worse.",
        "A halfling’s even temper can sometimes be a bit off-putting to other races, especially when it’s exhibited in the face of incredible danger. A few find halfling cheerfulness and determination to be irritating, but many of those people change their minds once that tenacity is the factor that saves the day. Halflings are almost never offended by these attitudes, seeing them as natural inclinations of less confident races.",
        "While not mistrustful of technology in general, many halflings look askance at cybernetic implants and biotech augmentations, feeling that natural halfling physiology is pretty much perfect as it is. They don’t look down on those who use such items, but it’s rarer than average to see a halfling with dermal plating or retinal reflectors. A halfling that accidentally loses a limb might consent to having a cybernetic replacement attached, but most halflings would spend the extra credits to make that prosthetic look as much like the lost limb as possible.",
        "Halflings rarely lack for work. Media companies and corporations love an irrepressible halfling star or spokesmodel, and many starship captains believe in the stereotype of the fearless and steady-handed halfling pilot. Those halflings who turn to adventure find good use for their quick reflexes and boundless charm as envoys and operatives, though their general adaptability allows them to shine in almost any role.",
        "Wandering halflings aboard starships typically finds spaces—even an area as small as a corner of a cargo bay—on their vessels to decorate in their own personal styles. They pin up keepsakes from their home planets (or colonies), such as dried flowers or scraps of metal from defeated hostile robots.",

Many halforcs have tusk-like canines protruding from their lower jaws, as well as slightly pointed ears and large brows that give them a brooding appearance.",

Unfortunately, most of the free half-orcs who inhabit the rest of the solar system are not treated much better, shunned or vilified due to traditional prejudices stretching back into the Gap. The fact that these prejudices sometimes drive half-orcs to become exactly the brutal criminals society expects only reinforces this negative cycle. Those halforcs who do find acceptance tend to do so within enclaves of their own kind, among androids and other marginalized groups, or in militaristic orders where the fear they inspire can be turned to their advantage. Though society funnels them toward roles as soldiers, operatives, and intimidating envoys, some find solace as mechanics, preferring machines to people. They get along particularly well in vesk mercenary groups, as the reptilian aliens lack the traditional prejudices of the Pact Worlds.",

This subculture uses piercings, plastic surgery, and even cybernetic enhancements to express themselves and set themselves apart from the mainstream. Many half-orcs feel the call to join the Augmented, and such “steelskins” may not even consider themselves half-orcs anymore, looking down on members of their race who have kept their natural forms.",
        "For those half-orcs least accepted by society, one popular option is to push beyond the boundaries of civilization, venturing to new planets where they can build colonies. While some of these orc-blooded colonial groups simply set down roots and live in peace within their small enclaves, others become professional pioneers. These latter groups take on contracts as first-wave colonists, landing on planets under extreme circumstances and enduring the hardest and most dangerous period of a colony’s founding, then sell off rights to a “softer” group of colonists so that they can go start a new colony elsewhere. This dangerous, extremely skilled work is well-compensated, and thus despite their rough reputation and appearance, half-orc professionals in organizations like the Halfblood Frontier Company are often extremely wealthy, sometimes retiring to act as patrons for other half-orc ventures.",

        "Like many native creatures of the Ash’Akan system in the Vast, the hanakans developed magical skills early in their evolution. Unlike most creatures, however, they eventually attained sapience, and as their minds and bodies grew more complex, they embraced magic to help tame their world, just as many humanoids relied on tools and technology. The hanakans’ mastery of magic allowed them to construct vast cities and megastructures, communicate over large distances, and produce whatever goods they needed.",
        "With their history and society steeped in magic, most hanakans learn the basics of spellcasting just as human children learn to operate technological devices. Their culture considers electricity anathema, and hanakans shun the electronic devices that most other sapient races depend on, instead meeting the needs of a complex modern society with magic and various hybrid devices. While nothing explicitly forbids hanakans from operating computers or wielding technological weapons, they view it with the same distaste most races reserve for necromancy.",
        "Hanakan religion teaches that they have two souls: a “child soul” that every person is born with, and a ssenavar, or “high soul,” that they create. To come of age, a child must forge or attune themself to a soulstone: a mystic jewel that houses their ssenavar and chronicles their life experience. Soulstones are cherished objects, and hanakans wear or carry them at all times. Soulstones can be passed down for generations, housing the magic of a dozen individuals and functioning as powerful hybrid items or solarian weapon crystals. A hanakan without a soulstone is viewed as a child at best—without autonomy or authority—rendering those who lose their ssenavar socially inert and grief-stricken. Consequently, one of the most respected callings in hanakan culture is that of the soulstone hunter. These daring adventurers work on behalf of distraught clients to recover lost or stolen soulstones.",
        "Hanakans resemble bipedal oviraptors, with long, lean bodies standing on two legs, thin arms lined with feathers, a flexible neck, and a long, whiplike tail ending in a fan of feathers. Each grows a unique crest of feathers from their head that, combined with their tail fan, enables them to express the broad range of hanakan emotions and forms the basis of their somatic language. Hanakans are omnivorous, using magic to grow a variety of crops and rear cattle-sized, herbivorous spiders called vanshas.",
        "Hailing from a world of weather extremes and cataclysmic volcanism, hanakans have evolved a symbiotic relationship with a bacteria in their lungs. This symbiosis allows hanakans to quickly adapt to changing climates and toxic gases and has helped them expand their civilization across the six planets of their home system well before Pact Worlds explorers made first contact. Hanakans remain dominant within the Ash’Akan system and have utterly subsumed the culture of their only sapient neighbor, the soft-shelled zendontai. Unified by the teachings of the great philosopher Ssena’ssess, hanakans are a largely peaceful species that settles disputes through debate, proxy champions, and subterfuge rather than open war.",
        "Hanakans are rarely found in the Pact Worlds, largely due to their disdain for traditional technology. Most hanakans refuse to travel in space except on hybrid or magical vessels. The mere existence of the Drift and its defiance of magical transport is profoundly disquieting to the species, much less the prospect of traveling through it. In their home system, they use powerful spells and gates to move between planets. Those hanakans who travel beyond Ash’Akan tend to be misfits who can tolerate or even appreciate technological societies, though even these rare few often employ hybridized weapon fusions and other workarounds. Most hanakans are solarians, mystics, or spellcasters of some sort, while mechanics and technomancers are almost nonexistent.",

        "While many societies were confused and shaken by the Gap, the disparate and widespread hobgoblin nations were almost entirely unaffected by it, and in some cases grew even stronger due to its amnesic effects. When the Gap ended, all hobgoblins still knew their own names and those of their superiors, their military rank and position, that they had earned those ranks through merit, and that their superiors had similarly earned their positions. This formed a strong common attitude that allowed many hobgoblin groups to work together, taking advantage of the confusion and consternation of their neighbors to wage quick, brutal wars of expansion against regions still coming to grips with the Gap.",
        "Additionally, most hobgoblin societies and groups immediately analyzed such things as their religions and social codes, and discarded anything that did not immediately make sense. For example, many hobgoblin societies found they had strict rules forbidding the pursuit of spellcasting knowledge and the use of magic, but this prohibition seemed needlessly limiting after the Gap. Similarly, many hobgoblin groups saw no advantage in worshiping their old gods. For example, many hobgoblin mercenary companies who work for the Veskarium have adopted the worship of Damoritosh.",

Thick ligaments fill the interior of a hortus, granting them excellent defense against kinetic damage, though slashing weapons can sever these cords. These plant life-forms are renowned for their lethargic ways, and they are rarely found outside the strictly controlled borders of their homeworld. Hortuses speak in languid, drawn-out, monotone voices that impatient creatures find frustrating to follow. Among themselves, hortuses speak in a language of spore releases that other species can’t easily reproduce without the installation of complex augmentations. Hortuses’ caps and stalks can take a wide array of forms, with many reminiscent of mundane fungi found on worlds throughout the galaxy.",
        "Over millennia, hortuses converted their once relatively barren world into a vegetation-rich paradise, using their unique biology to expel a combination of chemicals and spores that altered atmospheric conditions to their liking. By the time the Azlanti arrived on Croban V, the hortuses had already developed into a relatively passive, contented species, mostly due to the sedative-like atmosphere they’d crafted for themselves. The Azlanti conquest of Croban V was a relatively bloodless affair, as what passed for hortus leadership wanted only to preserve the lax living conditions of their society. The Azlanti were content to let the hortuses continue their sedentary lifestyle in exchange for use of their unique means of atmospheric modification.",

Most of these hortuses work in direct service to the Azlanti Star Empire, either as scientists or as living agents of atmospheric change. The Azlanti often deposit large groups of hortus colonists on distant worlds. Over the course of generations, these hortus colonies gradually transform small, self-contained regions to be more amenable to human life.",
        "The few hortuses who act outside of Azlanti supervision are renegades. Either possessing a modicum of genetic variance that makes them less susceptible to their species’ chemical spore concoctions, or having simply avoided larger congregations of their species, these hortuses each react differently to their freedom. Many renegade hortuses stand in opposition to the Azlanti, while others simply seek to explore the greater galaxy and find new meaning among the stars.",

        "Native to island-strewn Vesk-2, ijtikris are sapient beings that resemble squids, though they are terrestrial upon reaching adulthood. Each has an oblong body that they hold roughly vertically atop the muscular arms that surround their mouth. An ijtikri has two long and dexterous feeding tentacles that are tipped with pads that serve as manipulators and allow the ijtikri to use tools. An ijtikri’s head is close to the ground and covered with an array of visual sensors: an eye on each side of the head, three simple dorsal eyespots, and a pair of complex eyes on the upper trunk. This last pair allows an ijtikri to see without exposing much of their body.",
        "An ijtikri has a shell that covers the head and lower mantle, with a lighter exoskeletal lattice protecting the upper mantle. This facial plating gives rise to the vesk nickname for the species: stone‑faced squids. Many genes in ijtikris activate only in response to certain environmental stimuli, so an ijtikri’s shell shape and instinctive skills develop in predictable ways according to external influences. As a result, ijtikris from a particular region have a similar appearance. The common varieties include gray, indigo, and crimson ijtikris.",
        "An ijtikri hatches in water from a free-floating egg. Though these eggs get consumed by a variety of marine life, those that survive hatch into larvae that in turn feed on zooplankton. Once large enough to risk being prey to larger creatures, ijtikri larvae migrate into coastal waters and anchor to hollows in rocks or reefs. During this phase, the anchored ijtikri filter feeds and grows. By the latter part of their second year of life, a juvenile has built up a large enough reserve of fat and minerals that they cease feeding, break down the anchor, and undergo a metamorphosis into their adult form, including air-breathing lungs, before rising to the surface and swimming for land.",
        "Because they reach physical maturity without social interaction, ijtikris emerge from the water with only instinctive skills. However, each ijtikri has a cluster of ganglia known as a skenoseen organ, which helps the ijtikri smell and locate the nearest group of mature ijtikris. These groups incorporate any newcomer, whose adoptive cousins teach them language, culture, and the skills necessary to survive.",
        "Adult ijtikris mate numerous times over the course of their life, with each partner taking some gametes to store in specialized organs; however, fertilization doesn’t occur during adulthood. Instead, an adult ijtikri can begin a final metamorphosis at any point. Over several weeks, the ijtikri’s body fills with gas, splits its shell, and grows to up to 20 feet in length. The body achieves aerial buoyancy and rises into the air, gently propelling itself toward the open sea. Once far from land, the ijtikri fertilizes stored eggs and disperses them. Then, the ijtikri dies and descends into the water, where various life forms consume the remains. Modern ijtikris view this metamorphosis as a worthy sacrifice once one’s legacy is secure. However, advanced medical techniques allow ijtikris to fertilize eggs in small batches without such a transformation.",
        "Ijtikris started as nomadic hunter-gatherers. Adoption of stone tools 6,000 years ago allowed them to implement agriculture, build villages, and fend off predators. When vesk starships landed on Vesk-2, the ijtikris had city-states with iron-age technology. Resistance to vesk rule was brief. Within several years, the planet became part of the Veskarium. Ijtikris who have just emerged from the sea readily adopt almost any accepting group as surrogate families, so they are natural recruits for Veskarium organizations. Modern ijtikris have largely adopted vesk culture. Those who remain on Vesk-2 contribute to local industries, such as fish farming, salt production, and defrex ranching.",
        "Ijtikris clashed with the vesk most strongly over ancient ruins that predate ijtikri stone-age culture. Most are little more than foundations among paved plazas. Nevertheless, ijtikris avoided these places. The vesk instead explored them, despite ijtikri pleading, especially the island of Trafodi, which had intact edifices. Within a vault on Trafodi, vesk discovered the",

        "When they are hatched, ikeshtis are little more than gaping mouths attached to tiny, emaciated versions of their adult forms. A brood of ikeshti young will eat any organic matter they come across. As they grow larger, their brains become more developed, and they learn the rudiments of speech and other skills from their brood-minders, who guide them in their feeding habits. Such broods sometimes operate as living garbage disposals for large settlements, while others are taught to perform nomadic grazing that leaves the local biosphere intact. However, ikeshti broods left to their own devices seek out areas rich in organic matter and devour it all, much like a swarm of locusts.",
        "After 5 years and 3 feet of growth, ikeshtis leave their broodminders and settle down into a more civilized mode, banding together with other adolescents of various ages. These ikeshtis collaborate to advance their economic, social, and technological skills, typically working around the fringes of civilization as junk traders, mechanics, and scavengers.",
        "After 10 to 20 years of adolescence, ikeshtis begin to rut. They become violent and single-minded, their intelligence overcome by urges to fight and mate. Rutting ikeshtis once again eat voraciously, gaining new spurs and claws as well as hardened scales. If they find a willing partner, they mate, laying and fertilizing a large clutch of eggs. The two mates then fight each other to the death. If the male survives the combat, he becomes a brood-minder. If the female is victorious, she becomes a congregant. Rutting ikeshtis who never find mating partners continue to grow ever larger and more aggressive, eventually losing their mental faculties altogether and becoming riveners.",
        "Brood-minders quickly regain their prior knowledge and personalities, but their temperaments become somewhat phlegmatic and standoffish. They are driven by strong urges to manage a brood of young ikeshtis. They have no instinctive preference for their own young and seek to add newborn ikeshtis to their broods to the limit of their ability to control and guide them, even killing off the weakest young to open up space for candidates who show more promise. Brood-minders live a solitary life, focused on leading their broods to food sources and keeping them alive.",

They are bestial and irrational, remembering only the rudiments of language and unable to engage in more than low cunning. Riveners care only about killing, eating, and the thrill of battle. Ikeshtis who come across a rivener go to almost any lengths to put it down, as they believe the existence of these terrors brings shame to their race."

A group representing the Starfinder Society recently uncovered more about this species’ past, learning that izalguuns hid a trove of lost technological wonders under their modest villages.

Ja noi often gather hobgoblin soldiers to fulfill their need to command troops. For their part, hobgoblins normally embrace the presence of a ja noi within their ranks, seeing them as among the most perfect expressions of the hobgoblin form and treating them as mighty heroes.",

Known as kanabo, a term that means “the strongest,” these oni-blooded goblinoids breed true with both ja noi and other goblinoids. They have innate powers that often make them champions of their people, though they also often develop an independent streak that causes them to reject hobgoblin rules and society. Kanabo share the size of their oni ancestors, but their appearance is much more variable, ranging from stout hobgoblins to forms closer to half-orcs, and some even appear nearly human.

Khizars tend to be very protective of the natural spaces where they live, sometimes resulting in violent clashes, and many have recently joined or allied with the Xenowardens in defense of certain worlds.

        "Maraquoi are the primary native race of Marata, one of Bretheda’s moons. A primitive culture until relatively recently, maraquoi have made rapid technological advances as a result of interplanetary trade, yet they maintain many of the traditions of their ancestors. Maraquoi stand slightly taller than humans on average, and their bodies are covered with silky fur that acts like thousands of tiny antennae, transmitting sound to their sensitive skin. Maraquoi also each have a prehensile simian tail that allows them to manipulate objects.",
        "More than anything else, the maraquoi’s complex genders and familial structures set them apart from other races. Where many humanoid races in the Pact Worlds have a binary system of sexual reproduction, maraquoi have seven different sexes, each playing a different role in the process of reproduction. The ilsha, qsha, and susha (roughly translated to “earth-sire,” “sky-sire,” and “water-sire,” respectively) each contribute genetic material to the uisha (“sharer”). Shortly thereafter, the uisha passes the fetal maraquoi on to a klsha (“bearer”), who carries the child to term. Once born, the infant maraquoi must be passed on to a mesha (“cradle”), who carries the child in a marsupial-style pouch and nurses them until they wean. The most unusual sex might be the zysha (“facilitator”). While a zysha does not have much to do with the physical process of reproduction, their presence throughout is vital, as they somehow still pass on elements of their genetic code to the developing maraquoi. Monogamous marriage and similar traditions are unknown in traditional maraquoi culture, and despite the influx of media from other worlds, most maraquoi remain perplexed or amused by the concept.",
        "Maraquoi culture has a deep respect for life and the notion of family. The loss of several tribe members could prevent reproduction altogether, and so every life must be protected and treasured. This applies to other forms of life as well, and each hunt is traditionally followed by a ritual honoring the slain beast. Nearly all maraquoi consider themselves part of a single extended family, and intertribal conflict is rarely lethal. At the same time, the abundance of predatory fauna on their home world means that maraquoi warriors are both common and extremely skilled, using their abilities to guard their tribes. The practice of turning to mercenary work on other planets has deeply divided the maraquoi in recent generations: some believe there’s no conflict with their belief system so long as they never kill other maraquoi, while others rail against what they see as an abandonment of virtue and the exploitation of their noble guardians by outside interests. Even maraquoi mercenaries, however, retain much of their traditional honor system, with rituals recognizing fallen friends and foes alike.",
        "Many maraquoi treasure their ancient hunter-gatherer customs, and some tribes still dwell in cliffside caves and split-log longhouses in the deep forests, with only basic technological conveniences. Others follow cattlelizard herds across rocky plateaus but use modern vehicles and weapons. Still others seek to fully industrialize, and in recent years they have created impressive urban settlements, mining and exporting the planet’s natural resources in violation of the traditionally communal approach to property. Tensions are increasing between the various groups, and some maraquoi fear that their society is on the verge of fracturing beyond repair."

        "The small planet of Arniselle in the Vast features a few small ice-laden landmasses, but the immense oceans contain nearly all of its life, including the vibrantly colored morlamaws. These creatures, whose imposing physical size belies their generally good-natured personalities, have round torsos that end in a single wide flipper. They can breathe both underwater and on land, perhaps indicating that their ancestors lived on the planet’s continents in eons past. Currently, only particularly brave morlamaws venture onto the land, though swimming up to the surface isn’t uncommon. A morlamaw’s side flippers allow a large degree of fine movement, enabling them to manipulate objects and use equipment. A morlamaw has four tusks that they decorate with patterns meaningful to them as an individual. Their coloration doesn’t necessarily correspond to that of their parents, and they are sometimes born with multiple colors, which is thought to be a sign of good luck for the family. Morlamaws are typically between 10 and 12 feet long and weigh between 1 to 1-1/2 tons.",
        "Morlamaw society is concentrated in several dozen cities built into long undersea trenches. The largest settlements have extensive urban areas that effectively form small citystates. Each city has a leader, though some inherit their titles while others are elected. Their buildings tend to be very regular, with morlamaws often digging straight lines into the trenches rather than following the natural curvature of the terrain. Many morlamaws take to engineering and have developed underwater versions of common technologies, though computers remain an engineering challenge. While no other sapient species are native to Arniselle, the trench cities are easy to protect from the many dangerous predators that inhabit the cold oceanic world. Travel between trenches is risky, resulting in de facto highways along the most efficient routes. Morlamaws who commit dangerous crimes are exiled, sentenced to fend for themselves in the underwater wilds. Most eventually succumb to the dangers of the wilderness, but a few thrive, becoming even deadlier themselves.",
        "Morlamaw society is extremely orderly, and most morlamaws prefer to follow others. Their daily lives are often defined by the numbers of lines they wait in. Their diet is primarily carnivorous, and many morlamaws are skilled hunters. While their ancestors speared fish directly with their tusks, modern morlamaws are more likely to use spears, nets, or traps. Other morlamaws cultivate or gather shellfish. Some adventurous morlamaws hunt on land, and the meat they find there is considered a great delicacy. Spellcasters are extremely common, and even morlamaws who can’t actually cast spells are knowledgeable about mystical topics. Most morlamaws are also fairly religious, worshipping a large number of their own deities and attending religious services regularly. Each trench city has its own patron deities.",
        "The morlamaw language is based on gesture and expression as much as words. Gestures vary greatly between regions, and what is innocuous in one trench city could be insulting in another, making communication between the trench cities difficult. Music and dance also play a large role in morlamaw culture, and choirs and orchestras abound. Instruments are typically percussive or metal-stringed, since they must function underwater, and these are accompanied by vocals. Morlamaw music is very structured, with multipart harmonies. Their dances take full advantage of being performed underwater, as entertainers twirl with the currents.",
        "Arniselle recently attracted visitors from the Pact Worlds, thanks to the planet’s prevalent natural resources, introducing the morlamaws to creatures from other planets for the first time. Several of the major trench cities now have teams hard at work developing water-filled, Drift-capable starships. Particularly adventurous morlamaws have taken to the stars in other ways, getting jobs with mining companies, trading consortiums, the Starfinder Society, and AbadarCorp, who find the orderly morlamaws to be excellent employees. Among other species, morlamaws have a reputation as friendly, good-natured, cooperative, and somewhat gullible."

An ancient, close-knit species of primates, neskintis live among the dense canopies of continent-wide jungles, spending entire generations without seeing the ground. Myths among the neskintis speak of Nesk, a powerful nature spirit who blessed them with sentience and granted them dominion over the skyscraping flora of their native jungles. In obeisance to Nesk and her spiritual progeny, which are said to live in all objects, neskintis have nurtured the enormous trees of Gjor III through horticulture and magic, molding them into expansive hanging settlements.",

They initially ignored the neskintis, but a few anthropological expeditions discovered the species’ value as ecologists, after which the Star Empire began to recruit neskintis aggressively. Though rewarded with citizenship for their cooperation, neskintis found adapting to the Star Empire difficult.

Once the initial shock of space travel and the destructive power of modern technology wore off, the species retreated into a generations-long conversation about the virtue of adapting or rejecting such technology for their own use. So far, neskinti villages on Gjor III remain largely free of technology, but most neskintis who visit the wider empire find the return to a simpler life frustrating.",

Even the free orcs on Apostae suffer from isolation and drow propaganda, remaining ignorant of wider possibilities. On average, orcs have difficulty with attention, memory, and impulse control. Drow care little for where these tendencies come from, but their centuries-long influence has changed the orcs from the brutes described in pre-Gap histories. The drow have socially engineered their orc chattel to make them useful servants. From an early age, capable orc youngsters have a duty to care for any orcs who require help to survive. Aged or feeble orcs are permitted to endure only to teach the young valuable skills while indoctrinating them with the appropriate regard for their betters. Drow overseers keep watch over these enclaves, with the aid of half-orcs and a few elder orcs rewarded for loyal service with the right to “retire” to teaching positions.",

For example, an orc anticipated to be a technician might be conditioned to respond well and even take pleasure in technical work, such that her skill seems abnormally good. A bodyguard could be habituated to extreme ferocity in defense of a ward, belied by an otherwise composed demeanor. When an orc becomes an adult, she moves on to serve the drow house to which she belongs in her trained capacity. There, her conditioned mind keeps her bound better than any chains could.",

They dedicate their discoveries to their deity Yaraesa, patron of learning and science.",

Those who aren’t magically inclined might even resort to soaking their clothes and carrying large canteens of water for rehydration when exploring even mildly arid biomes.",

Their most common fear is that their desire to explore the galaxy and exchange knowledge with other species could ultimately result in their exploitation—or even their eradication. To cope with this paranoia, they flatly refuse to travel beyond the safety of their university-cities while alone, always accompanying at least one other osharu so they can protect and comfort one another. Osharus sometimes develop such a bond with equally sensitive members of other species, establishing a similar system of mutual support.",

Even two parents with similar patterns or colors can have completely different-looking offspring—it is not unusual for a beige, leopardspotted osharu to give birth to bright-pink or green tiger-striped progeny. This diversity is celebrated among osharu, and they find the predictability of hereditary outcomes among other humanoid species to be both unusual and fascinating—most of their university-cities have a district dedicated to the study of xenogenetics as a result."

        "The catlike pahtras are one of the most prominent species of the Veskarium, natives of a lush world they call Pulonis but that the Veskarium designates as Vesk-6. Their home planet’s relatively low gravity and fast predatory species resulted in the pahtras evolving into a lean race with elongated humanoid bodies and limbs. Pahtras’ fur ranges in color from tawny brown to shades of black and gray, while their eyes can be virtually any color of the visible spectrum. According to ancient traditions, a pahtra’s unique facial pattern indicates her character and potential for achievement. Some pahtra societies still assign adolescent pahtras to a specific social role after a reading of her face patterns by a pahtra mystic. However, the most recent generations of pahtras have begun to resist this often-superficial classification, especially as news reaches Vesk-6 of prominent offworld pahtras who break their supposed type.",
        "While the tradition of assigning status based on facial fur patterns is fading, similarly ancient rites requiring all pahtras, regardless of status, to participate in a dangerous, weeks-long competition in their 15th year are still very common. Such competitions involve dividing the adolescents into groups of a dozen each and sending them into the jungle. There, they face both natural threats and their peers in survival challenges and war games that result in more than a few casualties each year. The performance of a pahtra in this rite often dictates the trajectory of their social standing thereafter.",
        "Most pahtras are asexual, and a relatively small number of breeding couples bolster the population with litters of six to eight kits at a time. While pahtras frequently form lifelong, loving relationships with a single partner or small set of partners, they cherish individualism above all else. From their first steps, they strive to distinguish themselves from their siblings by developing and perfecting a unique ability. This inclination also makes pahtras highly suspicious of conformism—including that demanded by their vesk overseers—and while they can be deeply distrustful of strangers, they are also very protective of those they consider friends.",
        "Pahtra culture sees music and battle as the two greatest possible career paths, defining all other activities by how they relate to these callings. They also see strong synergies in the two pursuits, using music not just for artistic expression but also to coordinate battles and intimidate their enemies. Pahtras have perfect pitch and are natural musicians, and their music plays a central role in their society. They use arias, ballads, and elaborate musicals to tell the stories of their most legendary warriors, and they play bass- and percussion-heavy music to bolster their morale on the battlefield.",
        "When the first wave of vesk forces arrived on Vesk-6, pahtras were much less advanced technologically, and though their many nations had significant similarities in culture, they were in no way united or uniform. They were ultimately unable to resist the vesk’s advanced weapons, starships, and interplanetary empire, but their warrior traditions, knowledge of local terrain, and willingness to fight for their homelands ensured the vesk conquest was neither swift nor easy. Their bold resistance won the pahtras no small amount of respect from the lizard-like race. While some smaller pahtra collectives were destroyed in the war, others formed coalitions and grew into larger and more varied nation-states. In time, all these major pahtra nations signed treaties with the Veskarium, accepting vesk rule and a host of Veskarium regulations in return for largely maintaining self-rule in local matters. Only the enormous Command 6 military base that serves as the capital of Vesk-6 and base of operations for the planet’s vesk high despot is ruled entirely by vesk officers and officials; more remote regions are generally overseen by a consul who works with local pahtra governments. While most such consuls are retired vesk officers, a few pahtra consuls also exist.",
        "Vesk-6 and its people are now unquestionably part of the Veskarium, but most pahtra uphold their cultural traditions, trusting in their ancient ways of life to keep them distinct (and often far away) from the vesk ruling class. Some groups seek to punish the vesk for their conquest, even seeking to expel their conquerors and reclaim Pulonis as their own, but such efforts rarely do more than draw the ire of legions of Veskarium peacekeepers.",
        "Most pahtras who refuse to live under vesk rule instead take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Veskarium’s alliance with the Pact Worlds, and travel far from their home planet to try their luck as explorers, mercenaries, musicians, or seers."

        "Phentomites are native inhabitants of Orry, an unusual cluster of landmasses floating in regular orbits around a gravitational anomaly in Near Space. Thousands of years ago, the planet Orry was a technomagical utopia, but a massive industrial accident caused much of the world’s mass to explode into space. However, mystical gravitational forces created in this disaster allowed the land that survived to remain inhabitable, albeit with a thin atmosphere. Orry now consists of 10 country-sized landmasses, along with several dozen smaller formations, that slowly rotate around a central point—sometimes coming within mere feet of one another but never colliding.",
        "Orry’s surviving population continued on in the subsequent centuries, though the society lost much of the scientific and magical advancement of its forebears. The phentomites of today live in nations engaged in relatively low-tech artisanship, farming, and trading. They adapted to the low-oxygen environment much as creatures who live their whole lives at high altitudes do. Their eyes have adjusted to be able to see in the dark, and they’ve developed specialized nerves that grant limited thermographic vision; the latter might be a mutation caused by arcane fallout from Orry’s planet-breaking accident.",
        "The typical phentomite is 7 feet tall and weighs 175 pounds. Though mostly blue, a phentomite’s skin is striated with other colors, especially across the chest and arms. These streaks vary in coloration between phentomites from different areas of the planet; some have green and yellow bands, while others have red and purple lines of color. Their backward-bending legs give them a natural ability to jump farther than most humanoids, and their ungual feet grant them purchase on rocky slopes. Phentomites often decorate their large forehead ridges with dangling charms of religious or personal significance.",
        "The farmlands of Orry provide the phentomites with the majority of that world’s important resources, food and natural fibers, while the largest landmasses each contain at least a few mines. Phentomite cities range from the idyllic Niyriki, an artists’ enclave on the shores of Lake Eclipse, to the industrious Qabu, full of bustling factories. Roads of an unknown material crisscross each land formation; these remnants of Orry’s past have withstood the test of time and are now used by travelers on foot and by wagons pulled by hefty six-legged draft animals.",
        "Travel between the floating islands is made possible by an elite class of phentomites called bridgers, who use death-defying acrobatics to cross the gaps between landmasses and erect temporary rope-and-wood structures. Even with the assistance of bridgers, these trips can take several months to complete, and the largest, slowest-moving islands come close to one another for only a short time each year. Such a journey is incredibly hazardous, as a single slip can send an unfortunate traveler plummeting toward Orry’s gravitational anomaly—a certain death.",
        "The Pact Worlds only recently made contact with phentomites. AbadarCorp has constructed a small space station named Harmony-One that orbits Orry. Due to the gravitational anomaly at the heart of the cluster, landing starships on any of the Orry’s surfaces is incredibly hazardous. Orry’s trade partners have agreed to land offworld vessels only in a phentomite-designated area outside of Zisfahani, Orry’s largest city. Travel to other landmasses must then proceed along terrestrial routes, with the aid of local phentomite bridgers."

Whether settled or nomadic, ramiyel communities remain small by other cultures’ standards, as they rely on Ramiya’s abundant resources for their needs and sunlight for power. However, multiple such groups work in concert, as with Yaillan or the reseeding of Ramiya.",
        "The defining trait of ramiyel culture is their great reverence for life and nature. Ramiyels seek to live in harmony with the life around them, abhorring pollution, waste, and wanton disregard for other living beings. This preference does not equate to pacifism—predation is integral in ramiyel understanding of nature’s cycle. Huntresses are a vital element of their culture, which is rooted in a hunter-gatherer past. This respect for life extends beyond Ramiya. Even the most hardened ramiyel operative might spend a few moments after a pitched firefight to honor fallen foes and respect loss of life. Despite their spiritual proclivities, from which their mystical traditions arise, ramiyels worship no deities. They have deep cultural taboos against even trusting, much less revering, such entities. If another reason for this tradition ever existed, it was lost to the Gap.",
        "Individual ramiyels are most often good-aligned, with a focus on balance between the personal and communal. Even ramiyels who grow up outside their culture retain an innate sense of communalism and an understanding of and respect for life. Xenoanthropologists debate the cause of these traits, which would normally be attributed to nurture rather than nature. While ramiyels can find it difficult to break away from their communities, their curiosity can drive them to strike out among the stars. An adventurous ramiyel adopts her companions, whether the crew of her starship or a cadre of fellow explorers, as her community. She does her best to fulfill her duties within this group, although greedy or aggressively individualistic associates might clash with a ramiyel’s communal tendencies.",
        "Typically a ramiyel is about 5 feet tall, from top of the head to where the tail meets the ground, but the tail extends another 5–15 feet. Therefore, a ramiyel weighs upwards of 220 pounds. A ramiyel can also raise her body up another foot or so, shortening her tail, but doing so is uncomfortable for extended periods of time. When at rest or pausing in movement, a ramiyel typically coils her tail under her. Ramiyels live about as long as humans."

About two decades ago, a lashunta exploration vessel from Castrovel arrived in Raxil’s system and found the raxilites living in peace, having achieved symbiosis with their world through exceptionally advanced biotechnology.",
        "The curious raxilites sent a delegation back to Castrovel with the lashuntas. The two species have much in common, as raxilites are also intellectual and place great importance on community. After a time on Castrovel, where many raxilites still visit and dwell, the raxilite mission journeyed to Absalom Station. There, they obtained protectorate status for Raxil, just days after the Swarm attack on the Pact Worlds and Veskarium. Raxilites provided aid, mostly in biotech and medicine, during that conflict, though they also helped the Xenowardens advance their biomechanical starship designs. In turn, the raxilites, who lacked starfaring vessels before their contact with the lashuntas, began building their own biomechanical craft.",
        "Today, Raxil is a major source of cutting-edge starship biotech, though most of this tech must be acquired in the Pact Worlds. Raxilites are gentle and gregarious, but they restrict immigration, importing, and tourism to Raxil as carefully as they tend the planet. However, exploration is a key part of raxilite culture. With the galaxy open to them, countless young raxilites leave Raxil to see the stars, which often requires them to adapt to technology built for larger creatures. Raxilite bioengineers invented the Lifting Floret Activation Network (LFAN) augmentation to deal with the issue, and most raxilites have these modifications implanted shortly after sprouting.",
        "When a raxilite reaches adulthood, they sprout a flower. Flowering raxilites are lively and sociable, and especially with modern medicine, a raxilite can spend their entire life flowering. However, most raxilites choose to have children. A raxilite has both male and female reproductive organs, and to reproduce, two or more raxilites gather to exchange pollen. Such raxilites then transition to a seeding stage, with a puffball of seeds like those of a dandelion. Raxilites can also maintain their seeding stage indefinitely, and most do so at least until they find a safe place to plant and sprout their young. After releasing seeds, a raxilite flowers again within a week.",

In some cases, reptoids work behind the scenes to engineer “mysterious accidents” that allow them to discard problematic identities and assume new ones, and some conspiracy theorists or counterespionage officials tend to view high-profile deaths as signs of potential reptoid activity—either covert assassinations by the creatures, or staged deaths to cover for new identities.

        "Ryphorians are the dominant humanoid race on the Pact Worlds planet of Triaxus, known for its highly eccentric orbit, which causes generations-long seasons. These humanoids have adapted to their unusual environment with a peculiar trimorphism: those generations born in the winter years (winterborn) manifest short fur and narrow eyes to protect against snow blindness, those born in the summer years (summerborn) have hairless skin in a variety of dark shades to protect them from the intense rays of the summer sun, and those born in the years between the extremes of summer and winter (transitional) have a blend of such traits. However, with gene therapy and hormonal treatments available, an individual ryphorian’s appearance is no longer an indicator of Triaxus’s current season, and while unmodified Triaxians are generally born in their winter form to reflect the planet’s current season, taking steps to change a ryphorian’s seasonal form is currently a mark of wealth and status in some cultures. Regardless of the season of their birth, ryphorians have long and pointed ears, with feather-like notching along the back edge that automatically moves and adjusts the ear’s shape to help the ryphorian focus on specific sounds.",
        "Long ago, Triaxian society was defined by these seasonal changes. Winterborn ryphorians were understandably obsessed with survival, loyal but gruff and slow to make friends. Promises among winterborn were legendarily serious affairs, and modern Triaxian sagas and period romances still tell of heroes willing to sacrifice all to keep their word, regardless of the tragic consequences it might bring. Summerborn ryphorians, on the other hand, grew up in a time of plenty, abandoning their fortresses to wander as nomads. While most still understood the need to stockpile and prepare for the coming winter, summers were generally a time for passion and art, rebellion and risk. Transitional children, as representatives of the changing of seasons, were viewed with awe and fear.",
        "Today, technological advancements have enabled modern ryphorians to live in ease despite Triaxus’s season, and even the cycle of biological adaptation has been broken by magic and technology. Yet this cycle still lives on in the stereotypes various ryphorian “generations” (as the different subspecies sometimes call themselves) have about each other—stereotypes ironically strengthened by the addition of personal choice into the matter. Winterborn ryphorians are still seen as inherently more conservative and pragmatic, not least because they represent the natural, unmodified state into which most ryphorians are born during the current winter season. Those who convert to summerborn have a reputation for flightiness and lust, artistic tendencies and passionate adherence to new ideas and social and technological progress. Though the process of conversion to summerborn is now generally accepted in most major ryphorian societies and summerborn serve in all levels of public office, the act of converting immediately brands an individual as a member of the counterculture—a badge most summerborn wear with pride. Transitional ryphorians remain relatively rare and thus still maintain some of their mystery, with many powerful mystics and leaders capitalizing on this status.",
        "The ryphorians most often visible to other Pact Worlds citizens are the famed Skyfire Legion, elite mercenaries who offer their martial services to protect fledgling Pact Worlds colonies, Starfinder Society expeditions, and other such benevolent ventures operating beyond the legal reach of the Stewards and other Pact Worlds–based authorities. Many members of the legion form near-telepathic bonds with dragonkin partners (see page 40), a traditional, millennia-old practice that makes them particularly effective in team-based activities. These bonded pairs—sometimes romantic, but more often collegial—make crack combat pilot duos, whether serving on their own Skyfire Legion vessels or piloting ships for explorers as part of Legion contracts. Though particularly renowned for their abilities with both air and space craft, they’re also trained in other forms of combat, and can acquit themselves well on terrestrial battlefields when the situation calls for it, with some of them even maintaining the ancient practice of riding their dragonkin partners into battle. After the Skyfire Legion, the next ryphorian group to jump to most Pact Worlders’ minds is the famous battleflowers of Ning, genderless warriors who compete in broadcasted ritual combat, often attaining systemwide celebrity and renown.",
        "Ryphorians’ relationships with true dragons are mixed, as their world has a long history of warfare between its tyrannical chromatic dragons and their armies of ryphorian slaves and the free ryphorian nations of the Allied Territories (aided by the noble metallic dragons). While the wars between dragons and ryphorians have officially ended, with some dragons trading battlefields for boardrooms, many ryphorians still retain a deep-seated cultural hatred for their former chromatic conquerors, and it’s not uncommon for ryphorian nationalists on Triaxus to conduct illegal attacks on draconic holdings in hopes of driving the evil dragons from their home world once and for all."

        "Sporting a naturally hunched posture with drooping ears and a short snout, a screedreep’s bearing and expression make the creature seem to be waiting for a blow to land. It is perhaps this one feature that best defines the history of this species in the Azlanti Star Empire. Native to the Aristia system, screedreeps were among the first people to be taught the imperial lessons of brutality and subjugation. They bore the worst of Azlanti aggression and suffered decades of oppression before their surrender to imperial forces.",
        "Upon their capitulation, screedreeps lost Eostrillon, their beautiful home world, to the Azlanti and suffered acclimation to the imperial way of life. Since then, they have been dedicated subjects. Utter defeat yielded fawning, sycophantic, and subservient beings eager to fulfill Azlanti wishes, and centuries of devotion since have earned some screedreeps high administrative positions. Screedreeps are particularly adept at singling out plots within and against the imperial bureaucracy, identifying them before they can be fomented for too long and come to fruition. However, wealth and privilege elevate screedreeps only so far. Azlanti cultural structure constantly reminds all non-humans of their second-class status, and being the Star Empire’s favored non-human species earns screedreeps the distrust of most other sentient nonhumans under the empire’s thumb.",
        "Having lived among the Azlanti for so long, screedreeps have assimilated well with imperial technology and magic, although they prefer the predictability of technology to magical enigmas. Practicality and repeatability of experience are important to screedreeps, and they value universal systems. This ethos gives screedreeps something in common with brakims, and brakim technicians who make it to other imperial worlds get along well with screedreep managers. Primarily trained in vocations where a single administrator can oversee a network of personnel, screedreeps thrive in such roles. If screedreeps were less loyal or brakims more aggressive when among alien species, this relationship could be detrimental to the empire.",
        "Occasionally, failure to perform or poor luck can cause a screedreep to leave a public position—voluntarily or otherwise— and take up independent work. Other displaced screedreeps drift into criminal enterprises, running efficient racketeering operations, smuggling rings, or thieving organizations and eschewing more violent criminal endeavors. Such screedreep “facilitators” work throughout the empire, using their wiles to avoid notice, including the clever observations of their fellow screedreeps within the imperial administration. More than one criminal enterprise on Bortan II has a screedreep among its leadership, if not at its head.",

In water, a scyphozoan swims by expanding and contracting its bell, which propels the creature forward.

A juvenile inherits a great amount of knowledge and spends their first few years receiving intensive telepathic education from their parents. A shakalta develops their identity and personality during this time. After a few years, a shakalta child is considered ready to become an adult.",

Psychic compatibility and spiritual connection are all that matter to potential soul partners, and both souls must consent for this bonding to work. The deep link between bonded shakalta souls is one that surpasses trust and love. When two shakaltas agree to bond, they intertwine, creating a body of coherent energy to share, living the rest of their lives in this intimate proximity.",

The two deities are often represented together in shakalta shrines, as separate luminosities unified in an eternal balance. Shakaltas spend their long lives seeking experiences and attempting to bring light and positivity to existence. Many shakaltas remain on Accara IV, gathering in family-like groups and living lives of quiet devotion to their deities, philosophy, and one another. However, some shakaltas feel a calling to leave their home world for a greater purpose. Members of the shakalta Star-Guardians exemplify this urge, their loose coalition dedicated to traveling the galaxy and defending it against evil.",

As the forces of Abaddon spread, the shatoris withdrew to Perdure, another world in their system, to plan.

All their previous accomplishments had been razed to ruins, and their future seems to be one of slow attrition. Despair gripped survivors in the early days after their return. The wisest shatoris could see that their people’s despondency might accomplish what the daemons could not. Nine of these shatoris, called the Shabani, drafted a document called the Shaban, laying out ideal behavior and enshrining a culture of impartiality and tranquility, placing the objective over the subjective. The Shaban endorses detachment from the material world and rejects the worship of gods. It instead recommends philosophical egoism that leans toward benevolent self-interest, which includes working to benefit others, seeing the common good as an extension of personal welfare. Based on the Shaban, shatoris believe they should each find a purpose and use their gifts to fulfill that reason for existing, profiting themselves and others.

The Disaj system became a vassal of the Azlanti Star Empire with no struggle. Shatoris serve the Azlanti with quiet obedience, fearing for their species’ survival. Still, some brave shatoris act subtly against the empire. As highly skilled servants, shatoris conduct research and fill bureaucratic roles essential to the empire’s stability and expansion. Many of these privileged positions allow shatoris to influence the course of the empire’s policy and future, and the stoic immortals hope the long-term impact of their actions changes the empire for the better of all.",

Such shatoris remain in imperial space, hunting for ways to alter their fate. A few shatoris, however, are bold enough to take greater risks and travel the galaxy in search of answers and new possibilities."

        "The world of Shimrinsara, deep in the Vast, is constantly plagued by violent storms, but seven glittering dome-cities protrude through the tempestuous clouds. These metropolises stand as a testament to the perseverance and resourcefulness of the planet’s most notable inhabitants: crystalline humanoids known as shimreens. Shimreens built their domes not only to protect their cities from the storms, but also to harness the abundant available energy that powers their civilization. According to surviving records, the crystalline people have been doing this since long before the Gap.",
        "Shimreens are composed of glimmering crystal, and the average shimreen is 7 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. Though their tall, angular bodies can be any color (or even clear), most tend toward cool, bright jewel tones such as blue, purple, or teal. Much like their radiant metropolises, shimreens glow from within.",
        "The most popular legend about how shimreens came to be holds that the first shimreen was kissed by lightning, rising out of the earth and into sapience—and that their spark has passed down through the generations. Whatever their origins, modern shimreen are not so much born as they are made. Pharasma’s Forge, once merely a small volcanic hotspot, has developed over millennia into a sacred temple of making and unmaking. Narrow canals, carved into the mountain’s face in ray-like patterns, direct small rivers of lava into creation chambers. To form a new shimreen, fragments from one or more living parents are placed into a chamber, which is superheated by lava until either a soul is attracted to the seed crystals and a new shimreen is formed, or the contributed shards are consumed. It’s possible for a single shimreen to reproduce alone, or for each member of a large family unit to donate a piece of themselves. Since shimreens generally live for centuries, when one passes away, their body is taken in a solemn procession to be added to the lava that powers Pharasma’s Forge so that they may contribute to the making of new life.",
        "Shimreens are able to change their body slightly to fit their needs, including shifting an arm into a crystal lance or adjusting their constant internal glow. A significant number of shimreens shape the crystals atop their heads to form crowns, while others let the crystals around their faces grow wild to form clusters they call manes— and some do both.",
        "Thanks to Shimrinsara’s endless source of energy, its citizens are employed chiefly in the pursuit of culture and trade, rather than toiling to gather resources. Two castes make up the majority of shimreen inhabitants: workers and warriors. Workers can have a variety of skilled occupations and include artisans, engineers, entertainers, and scientists. Warriors are mainly tasked with fending off attempted incursions from outsiders who covet the shimreens’ plentiful resources, though they are also skilled in hunting the wild creatures that survive unprotected in the planet’s harsh atmosphere.",
        "The seven glowing cities of Shimrinsara are called the Jewels of Shimreen, and the largest of these is Kaniqlu, where elected representatives from each city form a council of seven that governs the planet. While most shimreens are fiercely protective of their home world, they do enjoy engaging in trade with other cultures so that they may learn and grow. During shimreen holidays, citizens gather to watch parades featuring several battalions of warriors, all performing intricate routines that are a mixture of elegant, flowing dance and ruthlessly lethal combat maneuvers."

        "Collectively called the “shobhad-neh,” the four-armed giants of Akiton live as nomads, much as they have for millennia. Self-sufficient and able to construct their own weapons, they traditionally avoided large cities and the smaller races of the planet, except to engage in trade. As such, when Akiton suffered economic collapse, shobhads were largely spared the turmoil. In the aftermath, shobhads began to offer their services as guides, hunters, and mercenaries, often in trade for more advanced armor and weapons. Today, shobhads are highly sought after for their martial expertise, unparalleled knowledge of Akiton’s wilds, and unbreakable codes of honor. These warriors may operate independently, in their traditional clans, or in modern mercenary companies that blend ancestral traditions with the needs of modern military freelancers. While more shobhads can be spotted in Akiton’s new metropolises these days, the majority continue to live in the planet’s harsh hills and canyons.",
        "Shobhads tend to wear their armor most of the time, usually with a traditional rope or leather weapon harness. Life among the shobhad-neh is hard, and young shobhads are trained from preadolescence to fight. By the age of 20, a shobhad is considered a full adult, capable of defending both her clan and her own honor against even the most experienced warriors. A typical shobhad warrior stands 12 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds, and most shobhads who do not die in battle live to between 90 and 120 years of age.",
        "Most clans hunt, gather, and raid neighboring clans and corporate convoys for supplies. Shobhads believe that overt aggression isn’t a fault, but rather a fact of life and that everyone should be strong enough to protect themselves. However, honor is paramount to a shobhad, and breaking one’s word or clan law means a fate worse than death. The laws of city folk, on the other hand, mean little unless they’ve been agreed to.",
        "Shobhads only rarely establish permanent settlements. A single clan may wander thousands of miles of open desert, their territory overlapping with that of other clans or species with very few disputes. While most clans remain on Akiton, their expertise in warfare means there’s always steady mercenary work for shobhad iconoclasts willing to travel, and a few clans have traded their caravans for starships. Such adventurers can often be found working for corporations or groups such as the Starfinder Society, usually as hired muscle. Some shobhads find themselves overtaken by nearly insatiable wanderlust, even after just a single off-planet job, and rarely set foot on Akiton again."

        "Near-ubiquitous inhabitants of the planet Vesk-3, skittermanders led a simple, mostly agrarian lifestyle before the Veskarium annexed their planet. They have a unique outlook: individualistic without being anarchic, and somehow unable (or perhaps unwilling) to grasp the concept of permanent governance. They understand and enjoy teamwork, and naturally follow a qualified leader to undertake large projects such as the building of domiciles, but once that task has been completed, the leader doesn’t continue to hold sway over the others. Coupled with their unusual life cycle, it would seem as if skittermanders would be very difficult to rule. But such is not exactly the case.",
        "When vesk warships appeared in the sky, skittermanders across Vesk-3 were more than happy to get out of the invaders’ way—not out of fear, but more because of their innate desire to help. Skittermanders instinctively recognized the Veskarium’s superior strength and felt they could best aid the empire by simply not being in the same location as its soldiers. In this way, skittermanders believed the vesk could quickly achieve their goals and move on. They didn’t understand the vesk’s aim was to subdue their world. Since vesk’s code of honor forbade them from shooting the cheerfully acquiescent skittermanders in the back, the invaders were confused and infuriated by the situation.",
        "Eventually, in a meeting that the empire notes as the official date that Vesk-3 was conquered, a vesk general plainly told a group of skittermanders that the Veskarium ruled their planet. The skittermanders nodded and got back to their lives. Since then, the empire has ruled Vesk-3, though it hasn’t truly been in control of it. Skittermanders cheerfully accept jobs given to them by vesk, but never truly acknowledge the vesk as being in charge. Some outside the Veskarium believe skittermanders are being deliberately obtuse, reaping all the technological and social benefits the empire offers while still partially maintaining their freedom as a society, but no skittermander has ever confirmed this theory.",
        "Today, skittermanders can be found throughout the Veskarium, often serving in clerical positions that allow them to aid as many people as possible. They have fully embraced technology and enjoy the many sights the galaxy has to offer, traveling to the Pact Worlds and beyond. Those who employ skittermanders quickly learn to give them missions that have open-ended parameters, as a skittermander who feels she has completed a task won’t necessarily report back to a superior for further instructions if she finds someone else who needs her help first. Outsiders often find them cheerfully manic, noting a goblin-like flair for the ridiculous but none of that race’s innate malice.",
        "Though skittermanders are mammals, they begin life in something akin to a larval stage. A skittermander whelp looks like a miniature version of an adult, but with more prominent ears and a tiny, secondary mouth on its abdomen. Once born, whelps are left to fend for themselves. They are truly omnivorous, capable of digesting fruits, leaves, raw meat, and seeds. Additionally, a whelp’s secondary mouth allows it to attach itself to large prey and feed at its leisure. Thanks to a numbing mucus secreted by this mouth, less intelligent animals rarely even notice the whelp’s samplings. A swarm of skittermander whelps has been known to bring down a trundling bovine monoux in a matter of minutes.",
        "After 6 years, whelps mature into adult skittermanders, begin to walk upright, and lose their secondary mouths, but they maintain their taste for anything remotely edible. Skittermanders living in tropical climes have short, soft fur, while their arctic cousins grow tough, shaggy hair. Their coloration varies even more, with tones of blue, green, and violet being the most common, but with no obvious correlation to their surroundings.",

        "Diminutive creatures resembling cuttlefish, stelliferas evolved in a deep-sea environment and spent millennia as nomads, developing psychic abilities and exploring their watery planet, Parin. The itinerant and dispersed nature of their society made it so that when Azlanti landed and started harvesting resources, it took centuries of pollution and climate change before the stelliferas realized they were on a crash course with extinction. They began to experiment with ways of living beyond their native environment and developed psychokinetic water bodies that allow them to survive outside their element. Stelliferas normally converse through a complex color language, changing skin and nearby water to various hues, supplemented with limited telepathy, so they had to rely on augmentations to communicate with their planet’s invaders.",

Today, stelliferas have spread across the Star Empire, seeding worlds with colonies and minimizing chances that a single event might cause their annihilation. Most stelliferas prefer life underwater, but others are eager explorers of land and space, and their psychokinetic water bodies are now familiar to travelers across the empire.",

The hydrobody affords the stellifera the size and reach of a Medium creature, and while unclad, it can fit through any opening the stellifera can without squeezing.

In addition, a stellifera in a hydrobody takes the bleed effect from only a wound or severe wound critical hit effect, is immune to gases and inhaled poisons, and gains a +4 racial bonus to Fortitude saving throws against diseases and poisons of the contact or injury types. The hydrobody slowly exchanges oxygen with the surrounding atmosphere or liquid, including environmental protections from armor, allowing the stellifera to breathe as if he were underwater. The nature of this body makes the stellifera immune to most effects of vacuum as well as atmospheric or underwater pressure. The hydrobody stores enough oxygen at one time for a stellifera to go 1 hour without oxygen exchange from his surroundings. After that time, he risks suffocation."

Pre-Gap accounts speak of a small and usually isolationist population of strix on vanished Golarion. Today, strix still tend to keep to themselves, especially in the race’s most concentrated population in the Pact Worlds: a mysterious spire called Qidel, Aerie of the Sun, on Verces.",
        "Non-strix entry into Qidel is highly regulated, and the strix are tight lipped about their culture within the structure. This has led some to speculate that Qidel’s strix are little more than spies, but the winged people’s generally magnanimous nature has prompted most civilized species to dismiss such suspicions as prejudiced nonsense. Despite their generous dispositions, strix sometimes struggle to integrate into wider Vercite culture. Accustomed to a communal culture, where everything from biotechnical engineering to child-rearing involves an entire community, strix often find the verthani’s focus on individuality and personal achievement exhausting. As a result, many strix who leave Qidel have opted to leave Verces altogether and pursue adventure and learning offworld.",
        "Strix’s biological functions have long since adapted to living in dark places, whether it be Qidel or another such enclave elsewhere. As a result, their eyes are typically milky and lack pupils; furthermore, given their powerful necks and ability to fly, their ocular muscles rarely need to accommodate moving in their sockets. This results in strix constantly craning their heads in a birdlike manner that, along with the rest of strix’s appearance, can make them seem eerie to other species.",
        "Though they share little about their home culture even with trusted friends, strix are deeply distrustful of magic but are natural technophiles. They take to technology as easily as they can fly through the air, leading some to believe that strange and incredible technology must play a major part of the life in Qidel. They often heavily augment their bodies with cybernetics—some of their own creation—and can be invaluable as technomancers and mechanics aboard exploration vessels."

        "Of all the species known to the Pact Worlds, the tortoise-like telias have perhaps the most complex relationship with the Gap. They are long-lived creatures—most live to be 1,000—and their vast experience has taught them that memory is mutable and (for other species) fleeting, so the Gap is to them just an exaggeration of this constant truth. Whereas elves, many of whom also lived through the Gap, might stew over memories of a betrayal lost to the Gap, a telia is generally glad for the opportunity to let go of a similar grievance, imagining the many possibilities of what might have taken place in their own past.",
        "Over time, a telia’s scaled shell changes pattern and color based on the telia’s experiences. Each bony plate, or scute, is a comprehensive physical record of the creature’s experiences, radiating a series of fine rings from its center. The rings’ color and shape differences give subtle clues to the telia’s experiences. Times of great joy, learning, and discovery often produce brightly colored and clearly defined rings, while darker times can result in cloudy, imprecise portions. Individuals older than a few hundred years are apparent from the scrambled or sometimes totally absent markings on the edges of their scutes—physical evidence of the scrambled time of the Gap.",
        "Telias have exceptional control over their memories. Some choose to forget entire centuries in a bid to excise trauma or in hopes of again experiencing the joy of discovering their passions. Most, however, trim only bad habits, bits of bias, and old grudges. Partially as a result of this practice, telias are genial and relaxed. Some underestimate telias based on their advanced age, but most telias are generous in deliberately ignoring such prejudice, having only pity for the narrow views of such short-lived creatures. In fact, telia culture considers individual blame to be abhorrent, which means some see telias as shiftless or incapable of accepting or assigning responsibility. To the typical telia, however, the vast causal nexus that leads to any given outcome is too nebulous to oversimplify. In their view, one can’t blame a creature without in part blaming its community, its family, and its ancestors—and in turn their families and community, onward to infinity. As a result, most telias are quick to forgive those who wrong them.",
        "Storytelling is central to telia society, and most are well practiced in the craft. Though telias devised a written language long before the Gap, they rarely use it today. Instead, telias embrace an oral tradition, passing down even complex technological information entirely verbally. They take an unhurried approach to learning, and it is common for a telia engineer to spend many decades as an apprentice. While they understand why other species rely on written records, most telias would much rather listen to a story told well than read from a screen. Telias are curious creatures, and when their travels take them away from their communities, they take their stories along with them in the form of video and audio recordings. Among an adventuring telia’s most precious possessions is their digital archive of their friends’ and family’s favorite stories.",
        "Telias originated on Pygos, the only inhabited planet in its Near Space system, rich with coral reefs, continent-spanning jungles, and complex cave systems, all teeming with unusual life. Thanks to their technological know-how, telias were among the first in the galaxy to correctly interpret Triune’s signal and build Drift engines. However, the ending of the Gap proved much more disorienting to telias than to shorter-lived species, and it was only after decades of debate that a small delegation of telias first left their home world. Once introduced to the broader galaxy, telias have fallen in love with the near infinite diversity of life and experience available beyond their own star system, and they regularly make trips to the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium. The average telia is 4-1/2 feet tall and weighs 200 pounds."

Tieflings might have horns, vestigial wings, or cloven hooves, while aasimars may have glowing eyes or a metallic sheen to their hair and skin.",
        "Because of their innate curiosity, humans are more likely to dally with outsiders, and as a consequence, a significant percentage of planar scions living in the Pact Worlds are descended from humans. However, because humans are far less populous than in pre-Gap eras, planar scions descended from other humanoid races are now far more numerous. A planar scion might pass for a member of the humanoid parent’s species, or the scion’s otherworldly features could make their origin obvious to those who are familiar with the species’ normal characteristics. Those whose outsider blood is evident still find acceptance in most major settlements across the Pact Worlds, where diverse beings coexist in peace. On Absalom Station, the hub of interspecies relations, few people bat an eye when they meet an aasimar or tiefling.",

The demon-worshiping drow of Apostae see tieflings as a favor from demonic patrons, while the elves of Sovyrian on Castrovel are likely to banish children who bear such fiendish heritage.

The original trox were eight-legged arthropods until a time long before the Gap when Nchak’s spiritual leader, believed to be a mortal incarnation of Hylax, ordered their magical transformation into their current humanoid form. Spellcasters made four of the trox’s eight legs into powerful limbs, shaped mandibles into scythes, and transformed chitin into layered armor plates that can flare in an intimidating display.",

These further-altered trox disappeared when Golarion did, but their story is well known to Nchak’s trox, making them even more vehement opponents of slavery.",

On Nchak, they are protectors of the spiritual center of Hylax worship, and they greet all peaceful visitors with humility and grace.

Despite their might, they prefer to use their imposing presence to defuse conflict before it starts.",

        "Dykon, one of Bretheda’s numerous moons, is legendary for its entirely silicon-based ecosystem. While many carbon-based life-forms from other Pact Worlds have since settled there, mining valuable crystals and hunting the silicon predators for their biologically produced superconductors, the world’s crystalline forests and faceted plateaus have also produced their own intelligent races, most notably the famed urogs.",
        "Urog anatomy can be deceptive. When encountered in their everyday or “traveling mode,” they almost resemble crystalline slugs or snails, their shimmering shell-scales hanging down almost to the ground and hiding their limbs as they float along like hovercrafts on a thin cushion of electromagnetism produced by microscopic cilia. It’s only when they’re in “engagement mode”—whether that means mating, fighting, or interacting directly with other races or their environment—that they rear up and unfold their multiple sets of articulated limbs. While every urog has a powerful beak adorning its head-stalk, this is used solely for fighting and reproduction. Food consumption actually occurs underneath an urog, as it uses the localized electromagnetic effects of its cilia to gradually break molecular bonds and tear tiny pieces off whatever it’s consuming. These “bites” are so microscopic that it’s often hard for other races to even tell what’s happening, with the item in question simply eroding steadily without any obvious markings. Though this allows urogs to eat nearly anything, breaking off and absorbing only the molecules they need and leaving aside the ones they don’t, they prefer the silicon-based plant life of their home. This peculiar method of absorbing nutrients also makes them nearly impossible to poison or drug, as their bodies simply discard any unnecessary ingested molecules.",
        "With plenty of options for food and few predators thanks to their size and sturdy frames, urogs are free to spend most of their time in contemplation. Constantly inspired by the complex geometry of their crystalline world, they wander seemingly at random across the moon’s surface, alone or in loose coalitions, working on mathematical problems or conducting enigmatic experiments. Their languid pace belies their exceedingly sharp intellect; indeed, it is likely because of their laser-like focus on unlocking the galaxy’s most esoteric mathematical and scientific secrets that they can be somewhat slow to react to external stimuli.",
        "Urogs often become single minded in finding the most efficient solution to a problem, spending untold hours just to shave seconds off a given process. This reputation for exactitude has made the crystalline creatures sought-after astrogators, consultants, engineers, and scientists in the Pact Worlds, though most members of other races who work with them acknowledge that such relationships can be challenging, to put it mildly. Though largely friendly— at least by their own standards—urogs are creatures with little appreciation for social niceties. A bored urog will think nothing of tuning out the person speaking to them or even wandering away entirely, regardless of how powerful the speaker may be, or how potentially life-threatening the matter they’re discussing. Even those who do prove themselves worthy of an urog’s attention must still deal with its brusque personality. Urog emotions are difficult for most other creatures to understand, and resolve primarily around the satisfaction of solving a problem, disappointment at failure, or the excitement of a promising line of inquiry. As such, urogs readily point out mistakes, whether their own or others’. While this is in the interest of improving performance and achieving better results, few humans have the patience and poise to graciously accept an enthusiastic urog’s stream of constant criticism.",
        "Urogs who choose lives of adventure often do so because they believe mathematical and scientific secrets hide in pockets of the galaxy that simply can’t be observed from their limited vantage point on a small moon—and often because they distrust the rigor of the scholarship produced by other species. Urogs who leave Dykon for long periods sometimes suffer an attenuation of their race’s special abilities, likely due to their changed diet and lack of certain electrical fields normally provided by the moon itself. Most successful spacefaring urogs eventually see the value in assisting their less deliberate companions, and they make excellent engineers and science officers on ships that have enough room for the large creatures and their overbearing personas."

        "Verthani, the primary inhabitants of Verces, were some of the earliest humanoids in the Pact Worlds system to build spacefaring vessels—a response to the struggle to survive in the harsh conditions of their tidally locked planet.",
        "Verthani stand 8 feet tall on average, with delicate features and long limbs. Their eyes are pure-black orbs, protruding from their heads in half domes like the eyes of a mouse, and they can change the pigment of their skin at will to have complex patterns. Nearly all verthani learn to control these color changes by the time they reach puberty, but babies and children display bright, expressive patterns and colors that reflect their current mood. Some adults also refuse to control them, seeing in their random patterns hints of prophecy.",
        "Long ago, verthani society was split into three castes: the Augmented, the Pure Ones, and the God-Vessels. A verthani’s caste is chosen during adolescence. Though few verthani today bind themselves strictly by the system’s rules, the traditions still carry a measure of cultural pride, and some verthani proudly wear the labels.",
        "The Augmented are verthani who modify their bodies with technology, usually cybernetic augmentations. This caste was particularly popular with those who piloted early aetherships (the elegant vessels verthani first sailed through the stars), and Augmented verthani pilots are still renowned as some of the most skilled in the Pact Worlds.",
        "In contrast, Pure Ones traditionally eschewed all technological augmentation and were responsible for supporting other castes, farming, and governing. While many modern Pure Ones have accepted at least some modest cybernetic or biotech improvements to their bodies, these verthani remain proud of their traditional caretaker roles.",
        "God-Vessels serve faithfully as living avatars of their deities, displaying this status by branding holy symbols called devotionals into their chests using either acid or flame. God-Vessels never cover up these distinctive marks, despite the fact that the scar tissue around them never fully heals and can no longer change color.",
        "Verthani culture is a model of independent, democratic cooperation. Forced to live on a cramped sliver of their planet, surrounded by nearly inhospitable lands on either side, verthani learned how to work together without violence or subjugation, and they choose to harness technology to increase resources rather than battle one another over scraps. Verces’s Ring of Nations remains a shining example of a one-world government in which citizens remain protected yet free to go their own way, and in many ways the Pact Worlds system itself was directly inspired by this aspect of verthani culture."

Vilderaros created complex maps of the night sky and used them to navigate and settle their entire world, building geometrically precise cities that mimicked the shapes of stars and constellations. Vilderaro culture is centered on geometric construction and ornamentation. Their bodies, settlements, and structures all bear totemic representations of ancestors, spirits, various nature deities, and other mystical themes.",

After recruiting numerous vilderaros for expeditionary ships, putting them to work as star cartographers in search of new worlds, the Azlanti elevated the species to citizens. Vilderaros are slowly coming to terms with the Star Empire’s restrictions on their rights to worship their own gods and carry their cultural artifacts beyond their home world, and it seems Azlanti monoculture is a weight the vilderaros might not be able to bear for long.",

The eggs a vilderaro produces can develop asexually in females, sexually when fertilized by an older adult, or via self-fertilization when a vilderaros reaches maturity. Juveniles are born physically capable but rely on the birthing parent for care. The parent or parents pass on genetic knowledge, allowing their young accelerated learning and the ability to function much like adolescents of other species within several months to a year. Desire for variety in this hereditary “education” has encouraged the vilderaro culture to favor sexual reproduction. When speaking Common and other gendered languages, vilderaros refer to themselves in feminine terms.",
        "Advanced technology is still new to vilderaros, but they have adapted well to it, especially with computers and navigational tools that allow them to extend their vision far beyond what they can see.

These capabilities make them excellent navigators and talented pilots, as well as skilled in many sorts of design.",

Vlakas emphasize on the well-being of the group over the individual, a practice that evolved from survival strategies required to thrive in the tundra of Lajok. While not wholly self-sacrificing, vlakas go to great lengths to assist, protect, and encourage their friends, colleagues, and kin. Vlakas frown upon self-aggrandizing leadership, and they respect those who display wisdom, listen the most, and speak the least.",

Most vlakas accept such responsibilities but deflect any unwarranted respect afforded them solely due to their title.",

These forelimbs each also bear a set of three grasping claws, with which a wrikreechee can manipulate objects, tools, and weapons.",
        "Wrikreechees are natives of Akchios, a lonely, watery planet with a fairly eccentric orbit around an orange main-sequence star. Over much of its existence, Akchios was covered in ice miles thick, melting only partly every 3 years when the planet drew closer to the sun. Fairly simple life developed in its concealed oceans, feeding upon nutrients surging from deep-sea vents. Only a modest range of more complex life-forms evolved in the lightless depths, and among these were the wrikreechees: soft-bodied organisms who developed rigid exoskeletons that allowed them to wander and feed during the warming cycle. During the cooling cycle, they molted their shells and retreated into coral-like constructions to conserve energy and socialize with their wintering colony. As best as modern scholars can tell, their kind evolved self-awareness and higher thought processes as a direct extension of this communal living. Though the species developed only rudimentary technologies in the absence of fire and metallurgy, their cultural love of history, mathematics, and philosophy made them a highly educated people.",
        "For the past 100,000 years, Akchios’s sun has grown hotter, melting more and more of the planet’s icy shell. Several centuries before the Gap, Akchios thawed enough to expose its immense ocean, revealing the cosmos to the wrikreechees for the first time. They had already developed complex astronomic theories by the time Pact Worlds explorers arrived 50 years ago, and although the wrikreechees still had only simple tools, they had the academic aptitude to quickly understand and adopt the visitors’ technologies. While still fairly uncommon beyond their home world, traveling wrikreechee scholars and engineers are renowned for creating wonders of architecture and adapting old technologies in innovative ways.",
        "Among the wrikreechees’ most important developments are a swath of pharmaceuticals and inexpensive biotech solutions that have helped them adapt to life in dry environments. Most importantly, these include a series of hormonal enhancements that allow a wrikreechee to maintain its shell year round and a biotech vocal enhancer that helps the creature project its voice and enunciate at near-human levels— without which a wrikreechee’s simple jaw and throat mangle a range of consonants and can barely project above a whisper in air. Much of the Wrikreechee language is conveyed through arm movements and chirps, with entire syntactic structures expressed solely through vibrations felt only over short distances in the water. These grammatical constructions are reserved primarily for terms of endearment, trust, and understanding. As a result, wrikreechees emit a nearly inaudible buzz around dear friends, and they find communication over comm units distressingly sterile.",
        "Temperature fluctuations remain the bane of most wrikreechees; because of their adaptation to seasonal stimuli, they become noticeably torpid in cold weather, and heat can spur practically manic bouts of energy. Those who can afford to do so wear suits with environmental controls to maintain their body temperatures—and prevent any mood swings that would otherwise result. Most wrikreechee travelers delight in clothing and crowded rooms, finding both to be suitable replacements for the colonies they left behind."
