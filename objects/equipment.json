The suit’s air supply doubles as ballast to keep the wearer neutrally buoyant in water despite the armor’s weight, and the idiomatic design accommodates and protects the kalo’s swimming membranes. While the armor can be adapted to circulate water instead of air, kalos prefer their comfort of their own technology. Similarly, the filters and seals of kalo encounter suits can be adapted to the needs of air breathers, although such suits tend to accumulate excess moisture and develop mold or mildew.",

Residential cryospikes are typically employed by firefighting crews, while industrial cryospikes is most often kept on hand in massive starship-engineering bays."

Lengthy application of this heat can soften many metals, which aids in sculpting efforts, but even a quick touch can inflict painful burns, allowing searing grips to double as low-profile weapons. The versions typically employed by sculptors are designated low-heat and high-heat, though this is a relative distinction, as both operate at temperatures capable of dealing substantial damage.

The grip has several layers of insulation to separate the wearer’s hand from the resistance coils lining the palm and fingers; as such, the glove is often mistaken for a simple well-insulated work glove. Lengthy application of this heat can soften many metals, which aids in sculpting efforts, but even a quick touch can inflict painful burns, allowing searing grips to double as low-profile weapons. The versions typically employed by sculptors are designated low-heat and high-heat, though this is a relative distinction, as both operate at temperatures capable of dealing substantial damage. The weaponized searing grip drops the pretense of being an artist’s tool, though those trained in its use find that its functionality doesn’t differ substantially from the other models."

The grip has several layers of insulation to separate the wearer’s hand from the resistance coils lining the palm and fingers; as such, the glove is often mistaken for a simple well-insulated work glove. Lengthy application of this heat can soften many metals, which aids in sculpting efforts, but even a quick touch can inflict painful burns, allowing searing grips to double as low-profile weapons. The versions typically employed by sculptors are designated low-heat and high-heat, though this is a relative distinction, as both operate at temperatures capable of dealing substantial damage. The weaponized searing grip drops the pretense of being an artist’s tool, though those trained in its use find that its functionality doesn’t differ substantially from the other models."

A series of fine, flexible wires along the edges produces a narrow magnetic field that turns the weapon into a streamer of glowing plasma in use.

A series of fine, flexible wires along the edges produces a narrow magnetic field that turns the weapon into a streamer of glowing plasma in use. Student plasma ribbons allow the user to build up proficiency; battleflowers trade up to professional, competitor, and champion plasma ribbons as they become more skilled with the weapons."

The magnetic field can also interfere with other weapons, allowing a proficient user to use an electroflail to knock opponents’ weapons out of their grasp. These weapons see frequent use among various Hellknight orders, which often custom order designs featuring grinning devils, complete with spiked wings.

An electromagnetic force causes the ball to stay within a predetermined range of the haft’s end—usually around 1 foot away—while also conducting a substantial electric charge to the ball that is discharged upon a strike. The magnetic field can also interfere with other weapons, allowing a proficient user to use an electroflail to knock opponents’ weapons out of their grasp. These weapons see frequent use among various Hellknight orders, which often custom order designs featuring grinning devils, complete with spiked wings.

Each has increasingly precise grooves for improved sonic damage that can disturb the inner ear and cause brief disorientation."

A successful Perception check (DC = 15 + the weapon’s item level) is required to identify a sword cane as a weapon when it is sheathed.",

Modern wielders use lances while mounted or driving open vehicles, such as cycle-riding raiders like the Vercite Rustrunners. Tactical lances are straightforward and widely available, while advanced lances are made of strong composites and have fine points to deal more damage. Elite lances have superfine points, and each has a particularly dense core for a more powerful strike.

Tactical lances are straightforward and widely available, while advanced lances are made of strong composites and have fine points to deal more damage.

Typically, the different beams originate from the corners of a square or triangular barrel, angling in to join at a single point on the target. A single-wave convergent laser emits a single wavelength, with all its beams sharing a color. Multiwave convergent lasers produce different wavelengths for each beam, using computer assistance to continually adjust the output, while a wide-spectrum convergent laser increases the number of beams until their joining point on the target is a white so brilliant that it’s painful to look at."

These wide-barreled cannons fire a barrage of magnetically accelerated darts that contain barbed cores rather than toxins or medicinals. While this prevents the darts from being used to inject substances, the barbs can lodge in a target’s body, dealing lasting damage. Dart cannons tend to see use in environments with some level of gravity, as no one wants to deal with the aftermath of a dart cannon’s discharge in a zero-g environment.

The storm and tempest models feature improvements that build upon the capabilities of static and aurora arc casters. Since there is little way to control which creatures are struck on the subsequent arcs, arc casters are generally used only by solo combatants or those with little regard for their allies’ well-being. More rarely, party members may take particular precautions against electricity damage, such as with a resistant armor spell or an electrostatic field armor upgrade, to protect themselves from an ally wielding an arc caster."

While many shock weapons have a chance to arc to a second target on a hit, the arc caster is designed to achieve that feat on every shot, and particularly well-aimed strikes can sometimes arc twice. The storm and tempest models feature improvements that build upon the capabilities of static and aurora arc casters. Since there is little way to control which creatures are struck on the subsequent arcs, arc casters are generally used only by solo combatants or those with little regard for their allies’ well-being. More rarely, party members may take particular precautions against electricity damage, such as with a resistant armor spell or an electrostatic field armor upgrade, to protect themselves from an ally wielding an arc caster."

A resonator generates sonic waves at frequencies set to resound within the targeted material, allowing the weapon to deal precise damage regardless of the target’s composition or protection. If the integrated probing function is employed before firing, the resonator’s sonic frequencies can be precisely tuned. Diffraction and refraction resonators align sonic waves in specific patterns, while linear and phased resonators focus the sonic energy through specialized matrices for amplified output."

A shoulder strap helps offset the weapon’s considerable weight, allowing the use of a top handle to direct output while freeing up the other hand to operate the controls. A resonator generates sonic waves at frequencies set to resound within the targeted material, allowing the weapon to deal precise damage regardless of the target’s composition or protection. If the integrated probing function is employed before firing, the resonator’s sonic frequencies can be precisely tuned. Diffraction and refraction resonators align sonic waves in specific patterns, while linear and phased resonators focus the sonic energy through specialized matrices for amplified output."

These weapons were first introduced to the Pact Worlds by skittermanders (Starfinder Alien Archive 106), though their current nomenclature (tactical, advanced, elite, and paragon) was imposed by other weapons manufacturers."

Utility, snub, impact, vortex, and grapeshot breaching guns are widely available on various worlds."

The various model names of this weapon—bravado, swagger, bombast, braggadocio, and gasconade—were originally facetious references to the character of those who tend to favor them, though many users embrace the names unironically."

Dual and dual-plus multistage rifles use a two-stage firing process, while triple and triple-plus multistage rifles employ a three-stage process for added range.

The electric discharge of the filaments causes a creature that fails the save to become staggered for 1 round. The electric charge dissipates quickly, leaving the area covered in sticky strands of high-tensile fibers, making the affected area difficult terrain for 1d4 rounds as though the grenade also has the mire weapon special property.

          "text": "D%Wonder Effect 1–5Each creature in the blast radius switches positions with another randomly determined creature in the blast radius (no save). No creature is placed in an area that is immediately hazardous to it (instead appearing in the closest safe space). 6–10Unlocked airlocks, appliance doors, doors, gates, lids, and windows open in the blast radius. Locks unlock if they are average or worse or controlled by a computer of tier 3 or lower. Magical locks that would open from a knock spell with a caster level check result of 25 or lower also unlock. After the blast unlocks a lock, whatever the lock was sealing opens. A creature can negate this effect on all objects it holds or wears with a successful Will saving throw. 11–15The blast radius becomes an area of zero gravity (Core Rulebook 404) for 4d4 rounds. 16–20The blast radius becomes the area of an explosive blast spell. 21–25Each creature in the blast radius must attempt a Reflex saving throw. Those that fail enter a state of reduced friction, which functions as if all surfaces they move on and all objects they hold are affected by a grease spell. 26–30Each creature in the blast radius must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or its powered technological items cease to function for 1 round. A technological construct that fails the save is also staggered for 1 round. Unattended technological objects receive no saving throw and simply cease to function for 1 round. 31–35Each creature in the blast radius is affected as if by the ethereal jaunt spell for 1d4 rounds (no save). 36–40Each creature in the blast radius is affected as if by the invisibility spell for 4d4 rounds (no save). 41–45Thousands of UPBs erupt in the blast radius, dealing 3d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature in the area (Reflex half). All but 1d4 × 10 UPBs are blown out of the blast radius, disappearing as they go. 46–50Each creature in the blast radius must succeed at a Fortitude save or sprout 2d4 armlike appendages. Some of these arms lack anatomy consistent with their host. Only two are useful, like a kasatha’s extra arms. These limbs remain for 4d6 hours, but can also be removed with remove affliction (DC 20). 51–55One First World beast is teleported into the blast radius. Roll d% to determine the beast: 1–15—Huge beast (such as an elephant); 16–50—Large beast (such as a rhino); 51–100—Tiny beast (such as a squirrel). The beast appears in an unoccupied space, only 1 square of which must be in the blast radius. If the beast doesn’t have enough room to appear, a beast of the next smaller size appears. The beast is no one’s ally. It has a 25% chance to arrive hostile, but is otherwise indifferent until it reacts to the current situation. Use the summoning creatures rules (Alien Archive 244) to determine the creature’s statistics. 56–60Each creature in the blast radius can hear the surface thoughts of other creatures within 30 feet of it as a bewildering jumble alongside its own. This mind-affecting effect renders a creature shaken. A creature can attempt a Will save at the end of its turn each round to end the effect. Otherwise, the effect lasts 1 minute. If a creature succeeds at its saving throw by 5 or more, that creature is no longer shaken and can focus the effect to function as detect thoughts, lasting for the remainder of the effect’s duration. 61–65Each creature in the blast radius must succeed at a Will saving throw or suffer the mind-affecting delusion that it has increased one step in size. An affected creature takes a –1 circumstance penalty to Dexterity-based checks and saving throws, as well as to EAC and KAC. It is treated as squeezing when a creature of its imagined size would be squeezing, and it is unlikely to attempt to move into areas “too small” for it. If a creature believes it is constrained completely, it becomes paralyzed. This delusion lasts 2d4 rounds, but the creature can attempt a new saving throw once on any round when something happens that contradicts the false belief, such as being moved when it believes itself constrained. 66–70About 5,000 harmless, beautiful flying insects appear within the blast radius. This swarm functions like a fog cloud spell that disperses after 4d4 rounds. 71–75The center of the blast radius becomes a gravitational anomaly for an instant. Creatures in the blast radius must succeed at a Fortitude save or be dragged to the enarest space adjacent to the grenade’s point of detonation. Any creature that collides with terrain that blocks line of effect or with another creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and falls prone. 76–80The grenade splits into 1d3+1 grenades, each of a kind determined randomly by rolling d%: 1–20—frag II, 21–34—screamer II, 35–50— shock II, 51–70—stickybomb II, 71–80—cryo I, 81–90—flash II, 91–100—incendiary II. Each grenade bounces as if its thrower had missed when throwing it. After each grenade lands at its new target, it detonates. 81–85About a thousand adorable, harmless Diminutive animals appear in the blast radius, covering the ground. This horde makes the blast radius difficult terrain, and at the end of every round, that area expands by 5 feet. Any item dropped or thrown into the area is knocked 1d4 squares in a random direction by the scrambling creatures, and knocked again when the area expands. The horde expands enough to disperse after 5 rounds. 86–90For 4d4 rounds, the blast radius fills with a windstorm (Core Rulebook 400). 91–95Each creature in the blast radius changes color to a random neon hue (no save). Roll 1d6: 1 red, 2 orange, 3 yellow, 4 green, 5 blue, or 6 violet. This effect is permanent but can be ended with a successful casting of remove affliction (DC 20), but if the spell fails, the target changes color again. 96–100The blast radius becomes a globe of vacuum (Core Rulebook 394), subjecting creatures initially caught in it to decompression. Air outside the vacuum rushes in to fill it after 4d4 minutes, unless the vacuum completely fills a sealed area, in which case it remains a vacuum even after 4d4 minutes have passed until the area is unsealed."

In addition, a solar flare grenade also sends out an electromagnetic pulse following the plasma wave. Within the same area, all technological objects that use charges, technological objects that do not use charges but are powered by electricity, and constructs with the technological subtype must each attempt a Fortitude saving throw. If a technological object with charges fails the save, it loses a number of charges equal to the grenade’s mark. If a technological object that is powered by electrical means other than charge fails the save, its functions are suppressed for a number of rounds according to the grenade’s type (see below). If a construct with the technological subtype fails the save, it is staggered for a number of rounds according to the grenade’s type (see below); such a construct can attempt an additional Fortitude save at the end of each round to shrug off the effect."

    "description": "You replace your entire hand with a hand made of reprogrammable microscopic adamantine prisms. With either a mental command or a programmable interface built into the hand, you can reconfigure your hand into the shape of various tools. The hand can contain programming for nine different tools, in addition to a configuration for a normal hand for your species. As a move action, you can switch the setting, causing the adamantine pieces to realign into the shape of the chosen tool. The tool has all the flexibility of the normal tool (or of a hand, if set to that).Programming a new tool into the polyhand takes 10 minutes, and you must choose either to fill an empty slot or to replace a programmed tool. The tool replicated must be 8th level or lower. The polyhand can replicate the moving parts of a tool, but you must supply any fuel or batteries needed for the tool to function. The tool cannot produce substances, and since it’s not very conductive (important so as to avoid shocking the user), it can’t serve as a power conduit or data transmission line. The GM has final say in deciding which tools you can duplicate. The tools within engineering kits and similar kits can be duplicated, subject to the restrictions above.You can’t replace the hand setting based on your biology, which is required for the polyhand to function properly. You can add a hand corresponding to another species in any slot that isn’t reserved\n for instance, a human could program her polyhand to replicate a shirren hand. This can’t duplicate features of a unique individual, such as thumbprints. You can install a polyhand into a prosthetic limb that replaces an arm as if the prosthetic were a natural arm.The adamantine construction makes the polyhand extremely durable (see page 408 in Chapter 11 for more information about adamantine). This doesn’t change the amount of unarmed strike damage, no matter the form your polyhand is in. The polyhand can’t maintain structural integrity if extended too far, so it can’t assume a form more than one and a half feet long in any dimension. Consequently, it can’t extend your reach.",

In addition, you reduce your miss chance due to concealment from smoke and fog (including that produced by a smoke grenade or an effect such as fog cloud ) by 10% (to a minimum of 0%); this reduction doesn’t stack with any other ability that reduces miss chance due to concealment. Dust goggles can also be installed in armor (or an android’s armor upgrade slot) as an armor upgrade. This has no effect on weight or cost, but when installed in this way, they do not count toward a character’s limit of two worn magic or hybrid items at once.",

A deoxy pellet offers some protection against these risks, and has gained some fame through the system due to a lighthearted marketing campaign based on the slogan, “Break in case of fire or giant bug!” You can crush a deoxy pellet as a full action that provokes attacks of opportunity. The magically enhanced chemical mixture within makes it so oxygen within a 30-foot radius of the point you break the pellet doesn’t easily diffuse to feed fire or flow into the spiracles of insects and other creatures that lack active breathing mechanisms. Natural fire goes out, and the burning condition deals half damage. In addition, vermin larger than Tiny are sickened while in the area (no saving throw). The change in oxygen persists for 5 rounds, but a light or moderate wind lowers the duration to 3 rounds, and a strong or stronger wind lowers the duration to 1 round.",

A motion-detection badge has 4 charges, which refresh daily, and an hour of activation uses 1 charge. While active, as long as you haven’t moved for at least 1 round, the badge emits a quick flash of red light whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature approaches within 60 feet, although creatures undetectable to normal vision (such as an invisible creature) don’t trigger the flash. This flash is sufficient to alert you, but doesn’t otherwise affect your vision or your actions. Reduce this distance by 20 feet for each interposing closed door or substantial barrier (such as a wall at least 1 inch thick). You can attune the badge to a creature by touching it with the item, which takes a full action; you can attune the badge to up to 10 different creatures. When you are within 60 feet of one of these creatures, regardless of whether you have moved in the past round, the badge emits a yellow flash to let you know an ally is near. Attempting to attune an eleventh creature causes the badge to lose its attunement to the earliest attuned creature. Note that in certain environments, such as a crowded shopping center, the badge flashes so frequently as to be practically useless for detecting approaching threats.",

    "description": "The static charge prevalent throughout Tarchuuva’s upper atmosphere has given rise to a recreational activity called static gliding. This leisure activity is restrictive due to the costs of the equipment and travel to Tarchuuva, but competitive static gliding was one of the most widely viewed sporting activities on Ilemchuuva. A static glider is a thin metallic sheet incorporated onto a minimal nanocarbon frame roughly 10 feet across. You can strap into a harness on the glider’s underside, taking a full action. The glider’s surface is designed with a microtexture that allows it to build up an electromagnetic charge and use that energy to produce lift. A glider requires no power source on Tarchuuva or during electromagnetic storms, but otherwise, the device requires a battery and consumes 1 charge per minute. While using a static glider , you gain a fly speed of 30 feet with poor maneuverability. You are flat-footed while using the glider to fly unless you dedicate two hands to steering it.",

Once per day, you can activate the deck as a full action. It projects holograms of 54 cards, which buzz around you. To begin the reading, you ask a question aloud to the harrow deck, causing all of the cards to come together as a deck; then, the deck uses hundreds of advanced pseudomystical calculations to deal a three-by-three array of cards for you, which it then uses to vocally interpret the circumstances surrounding your question. This works as the augury spell, with a spell level equal to the deck’s item level. Additionally, a mystic who has a digital harrow deck and who also knows augury can ignore the spell’s requirement that a Resolve Point be spent to cast it. A mystic can do this a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom bonus. A technomancer can designate a digital harrow deck as her spell cache. If she does, the deck’s AI integrates with her own consciousness, providing her with a +1 bonus to her caster level for divination spells and effects. Additionally, she can spend 1 Resolve Point as a swift action when she casts a technomancer spell to draw upon the algorithms that allow the deck to function, adding a +1 insight bonus to the spell’s save DC.",

The listed price and level is for a mk\n1 null-space chamber with a null-space tumor inside; rumors\npersist that larger and more disruptive null-space tumors exist. A null-space tumor has 1 bulk and can’t be permanently\nremoved from its associated chamber. You can’t purposefully\ncall up a null-space tumor from its chamber, but each time\nyou call up another item from the chamber, there is a 20%\nchance that the null-space tumor appears instead. When that\nhappens, the tumor’s unusual properties randomly cause one\nof the following effects (roll 1d8 to determine the effect), after\nwhich the null-space tumor immediately teleports itself back\ninto the chamber. The only way to destroy a null-space tumor is to destroy the null-space chamber it’s attached to.

However, you\nsee doubles of every creature and object, meaning you\nhave a 50% miss chance to attack a creature and a 50%\nchance to waste your action when you try to pick up or\nmanipulate an object.\n3You gain the benefits of comprehend languages\nfor 1 hour, but anything you write down or type on\na computer during this time instantly vanishes as\nper erase.\n4You gain the benefits of keen senses for 10 minutes, but\nyou take a –2 penalty to saving throws against sensedependent\neffects during this time.\n5The tumor produces a wisp ally (as per the spell of the\nsame name) that lasts for 1d4+1 rounds, but you don’t\ncontrol it. The wisp ally chooses its targets and effect\nrandomly.\n6You instantly regain 1d6 Stamina Points, but lose the\nsame number of Hit Points. If you have all your Stamina\nPoints, you instead belch a ring of iridescent smoke.\n7The next weapon you touch is affected as per\nsupercharge weapon, but it immediately gains the\nbroken condition after it is used to attack. You must\ntouch a weapon within 1 minute or lose this ability.\n8You gain a small degree of telepathy and can detect\nthoughts (as per the spell of the same name) for the\nnext 5 minutes. However, your idealized self-image\nappears 15 feet away from you, as per a 1st-level\ncasting of holographic image, and you have no control\nover this image.",

They were first developed in the Diaspora to allow miners to locate veins of metal by touch through the material of their space suits. It soon found applications for thieves and explorers alike. Using the gloves, you can perceive and manipulate objects close at hand without actually touching them, and you can even sense details hidden just below the surface. While wearing a pair of tactokinesis gloves , you can use the Perception and Physical Science skills to examine a metal or technological construct or object within your reach, whether or not you can perceive the object with other senses. In addition, the gloves provide a +2 circumstance bonus to Engineering checks to assess stability or disable a device, and they count as necessary tools for such purposes. You can attempt such checks without directly touching the target, as well as use similar abilities that manipulate technology by touch, such as the overload mechanic class feature. In a zero-gravity environment, you can use the limited telekinesis provided by the gloves to pick up and move objects of up to 1 bulk without actually touching them. As a standard action, you can use the gloves to deliver a disruptive pulse to an android, drone, robot, or creature with the technological subtype. If the creature fails a Will saving throw (DC = 13 + your Dexterity modifier), it is dazed for 1 round. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against this ability (regardless of the result), it is immune to this ability for 24 hours. The range of this telekinesis is limited to your reach, as you must be almost touching the target to manipulate it. Tactokinesis gloves do not function through a force field.",

As a standard action, you can deploy one to four motospheres from the same set; each rolls into its own square within 15 feet of you and instantly transforms into a vehicle similar to a basic enercycle with the changes noted below. If a creature or object occupies a square a vehicle formed from a motosphere would occupy, the motosphere doesn’t transform. You choose each vehicle’s initial heading as it transforms. After being deployed, a vehicle turns back into a motosphere after 1 hour, or as a move action you can turn it back into a motosphere by entering a series of commands on the vehicle’s controls. A single motosphere takes 24 hours to recharge before it can be used again. A vehicle formed out of a motosphere has a hardness of 7, and its hover jets allow it travel over both land and water (though not underwater). The vehicle has 14 Hit Points and becomes broken when it is reduced to 7 Hit Points or fewer. A vehicle that is reduced to 0 Hit Points turns back into a motosphere and can’t be used until it is repaired (treat it as if it were broken). Motospheres can be sold back only in their original pack of four for the normal 10% of the set’s purchase price; a set that is missing even one motosphere (or containing one that is broken) can be sold back for 2% of the set’s purchase price.",

    "description": "A black iron choker, an allegiance collar contains technomagical circuitry that adapts to someone who willingly wears it for 24 hours. It grants such a wearer the benefits and weaknesses of the fire subtype and the solar adaptation universal creature rule. The collar can be removed only with a special key or a successful DC 32 Engineering check. In addition, this collar contains a self-destruct feature that can be triggered in several ways: via a specific encrypted hybrid electronic signal, if the collar doesn’t receive a similar sort of signal (usually with paired encryption) in a specified amount of time, upon certain individuals uttering a command word, or if the wearer simply wills it. The collar also activates if a creature fails the Engineering check to remove it. Upon activation, the collar illuminates with red light and the device injects the wearer with nanites adapted to the wearer’s genetic code. These nanites destroy a wearer’s brain in seconds (death is instantaneous), obliterate the head in 1 round, and then disassemble the rest of the body in a number of rounds equal to 1 + the number of steps by which the creature’s size category exceeds Small. Once the process is over, the nanites decompose, and all that remains of them and their victim is molecular dust. The nanites are harmless to organisms they aren’t adapted to disassemble, and they decompose seconds after being removed from the collar. After the collar activates, its magic fades, becoming just an ornate piece of iron jewelry worth about 20 credits.",

    "name": "memory crypt",
    "description": "An accessory of bone-like plastic worn on the body near the brain, a memory crypt uses magical microcircuitry to keep an ongoing record of your experiences and monitor your vital signs. A memory crypt must be worn for 24 hours to adapt to your neurophysiology. During this time, it records nothing, but thereafter, it records your memories and experiences. After the item adapts to you, you can set a passcode to prevent those who don’t know the word or phrase you set from activating the device. A hacker can bypass the password with a successful DC 30 Computers check. If you remove the memory crypt or die, the item stops recording, though it preserves the record of your personality and vitals up to that point. Someone who has the memory crypt can activate it as a standard action. Doing so displays a hologram of you in a form called a memory ghost. This “ghost” can answer up to six questions. Its knowledge is limited to what you knew up to the point the record in the memory crypt ends, including the languages you spoke. Your ghost answers and converses with creatures as you would, with the attitudes you hold. If you trust the creature asking questions, the memory ghost answers truthfully and helpfully. Otherwise, the ghost can refuse to answer questions or attempt to deceive the questioner using your Bluff skill. A creature can attempt a Computers check to hack the memory crypt to erase it or force your memory ghost to answer questions truthfully. The DC to erase the memory crypt is 20 + your Bluff bonus or your level or CR, whichever is higher. The DC to force your memory ghost to answer is 5 higher. If a memory crypt is erased before being used to question the memory ghost it contains, it can be reused. Additionally, a memory crypt that contains an intact memory ghost can be used as the representation required for casting raise dead or the monument required for reincarnate. If used in this way to successfully cast either spell, the memory crypt is consumed. Once a memory crypt is activated, the memory ghost remains for 10 minutes or until it answers six questions. Magic powers the circuitry to replicate brain patterns. These patterns are disrupted if another power source is patched into the item in an attempt to prolong the memory ghost. When the duration ends, the memory crypt can be activated to project the memory ghost’s image, but the memory ghost is gone and can no longer interact, answer questions, or serve as the focus for raise dead or restoration. A memory crypt in this state can’t be reused.",

The biotech cylinder suspends an extracted brain in a matrix of biotechnological and magical slime that sustains the tissue and suppresses any mental powers the brain has. Inside the cylinder, a brain can survive indefinitely, locked away in its own thoughts. Attachments can allow the brain to see, hear, and speak; migo often attach such gear to access the brain’s information. Once a mi-go brain cylinder has a speech attachment, it can converse. It has all its skills and memories, but nothing about the cylinder compels the brain to answer questions or to do so truthfully. Most enslaved brains have been conditioned via pain and isolation to be compliant to questioning, but those within newly created cylinders might need coaxing to cooperate. A brain is susceptible to any spell or power it was susceptible to before it became disembodied. Some mi-go have powers that allow them to encourage or force a brain’s compliance or to telepathically probe a brain for desired data.",

According to the\nreport, Aurok 6’s aboveground nations enjoy peace and quiet\ndue to the contributions of a planetary law enforcement agency\nwith international jurisdiction, known only as the Adjudicators,\nwho wield psychic technology and governmental authority to\nact as judge, jury, and executioners when pursuing criminals.\nSince the broadcast, several weapons manufacturers have\nsecretly visited the planet, and now examples of experimental\n“judgment tech” weapons accessories can be found on various\ndark infospheres throughout the Pact Worlds. The most\nnotable of these is a scope, known as an adjudicator’s eye , that\ncan supposedly determine the guilt\nor innocence of a target. An adjudicator’s eye functions as a combined laser\nscope and nightvision scope, but it\nalso contains mnemonopathic\nsensors capable of scanning\na target’s memories for\nrecollections of a\nspecified crime or\nattempted crime. Once\nper day, in a process that takes 1 minute,\nyou can program the scope’s sensors with a single yes-or-no\nquestion testing responsibility for a particular crime, such as\n“Did the target attempt to blow up my starship?” or “Did the\ntarget plant the explosive device in the Eoxian embassy?” Three\ntimes per day, you can activate an adjudicator’s eye attached\nto a weapon as a move action. For the next 10 minutes, when\naiming or looking through the scope, the sensors automatically\nscan targets to reveal their perception of guilt or innocence in\nregards to that question. Each target must succeed at a DC\n18 Will saving throw or the adjudicator’s eye searches their\nmemories for information about the specified question. These\nmemories indicate only whether or not the target remembers\nthemself as being innocent or guilty of the crime in question,\nand they do not necessarily reflect the truth (as in the case\nof someone who has been affected by modify memory ). The\nscope places a “guilty” indicator over any target that recalls\nparticipating in the specified crime, and an “innocent” indicator\nover any target that has no memory of the crime or who\nsucceeded at the Will save. Deactivating an adjudicator’s eye is a move action. The adjudicator’s eye imposes a –2 penalty on attack rolls\nmade with the weapon it is attached to against any unscanned\ntarget or any target the scope has deemed innocent.",

When activated, the unit broadcasts a signal that most beings find subtly repulsive without being able to discern why the repulsion is occurring. The field affects an area with a radius of up to 100 feet, which you set. Upon entering the field, a creature feels the urge to leave—to remain in the area, the creature must attempt a DC 19 Will saving throw. On a failure, the creature cannot willingly return to the area for 24 hours or until the antipathy unit deactivates. Even if the save succeeds, creatures in the area are uncomfortable, taking a –1 penalty to attack rolls and Perception checks while they remain within it. You can use the biometric parameters on an antipathy unit’s controls to exclude creatures from the effect, but unless you have available biometric data that you can input into the unit for specific absent creatures, excluded creatures must be present when the unit is activated. An antipathy unit functions for 24 hours before needing to be recharged for 24 hours. The activation need not be continuous, but any activation consumes 1 hour of the unit’s power.",

    "name": "earthbound anklets",
    "description": "Made of industrial ceramic sometimes decorated with precious minerals, earthbound anklets contain an internal matrix of directional, weight, and acceleration sensors. Traditionally, the ceramic is created from soil constituents from the wearer’s home world, and the anklets are a way to carry a piece of that home. (The rarest earthbound anklets contain clay from lost Golarion.) Pragmatically, through quantum entanglement and magical means, earthbound anklets provide you a connection to normal gravity. While you wear earthbound anklets , you can activate or deactivate them as a standard action. Wearing the active anklets allows you to act as if you’re in standard gravity, ignoring the perils of high gravity and the benefits of low gravity. In zero gravity, you decide a gravitational up and down when you activate the anklets, changing this orientation as a move action. Activating the anklets in zero-g allows you to end the off-kilter condition as part of the same action, and you can then move relative to your subjective up and down as if you were walking on a solid surface. This standard-gravity effect applies only to you and to objects you hold or wear. If an object, such as a thrown weapon, leaves your possession, it is subjected to the gravity of your environment rather than that provided by the anklets. The anklets can remain active for up to 1 hour per day. This usage need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. Once you benefit from a given set of earthbound anklets , you can’t benefit from a different set for 24 hours.",

    "name": "necrotic mantle",
    "description": "Used by the commanders of the Corpse Fleet to conceal their unliving agents, a necrotic mantle is woven of bioactive fibers that mask the necromantic energies of an undead wearer and convert positive energy into something less harmful to that undead. While wearing a necrotic mantle , if you are undead, you have the aura of a living creature instead of an undead for the purposes of magic or technology that can detect undead. You receive a +4 divine bonus to saves against any spell or effect that targets undead, such as control undead . In addition, if you are undead and fail a saving throw against a spell that both affects only undead creatures and has an ongoing effect (such as control undead ), you can attempt a second saving throw after 1 round with the same DC as the first. If you succeed, you gain the same reduction in effect as if your initial saving throw had been successful. Additionally, any effort to determine whether a necrotic mantle you are wearing is a magic or technological item requires the creature making the determination to succeed at a Will save (DC = 15 + your key ability modifier). If you are undead and are by or in the area of an effect that restores Hit Points only to living creatures, you regain half the number of Hit Points instead of none. If that effect also damages undead creatures, you take no damage; this does not apply to effects that harm undead without healing living creatures.",

    "name": "swarm programmer pill",
    "description": "A Swarm programmer pill is a compact lozenge that contains a paper‑thin sliver of a Swarm programmer’s brain. As a full action, you swallow the tablet and it alters your biology, allowing you to choose one of the following effects. If you use another Swarm programmer pill within 24 hours, you become fatigued. Attempting to use a Swarm programmer pill while you are exhausted does little other than consume the pill. While under the pill’s effects, you attract the attention of Swarm components in the same way weapons that have the Swarm weapon special property do. Acidic Ejection: You gain acid resistance 5 and can launch acid as if part of your body (often the mouth) were a macrergate acid cannon, with which you are considered to be proficient. You are immune to your own acid. These adaptations last 4 hours. Alate Form: You grow a set of diaphanous insectile wings that allow you to fly at a speed 10 feet slower than your land speed. Your flight is an extraordinary ability with average maneuverability. The adaptation also grants you a +5 bonus to Acrobatics checks to fly. The wings function for 2 hours. If you are aloft when the effect ends, you float downward 60 feet per round for 3 rounds. If you fail to land or attain another means to fly by then, you fall as the wings detach. This detachment is uncomfortable but deals you no damage. If necessary, the wings can integrate with your armor. Once they have, removing your armor ends the effect by causing the wings to detach as above. Arolia: You grow special limb pads that grant you a climb speed 10 feet slower than your land speed. You retain this speed for 12 hours. If necessary, the pads can integrate with your armor, functioning as with the wings of alate form. If you’re climbing when the effect ends, you can still attempt to climb by other means. Bravery: You become inured to fear. For 24 hours, whenever you attempt a saving throw against a fear effect, treat any number you roll on the d20 lower than 8 as 8. In addition, if you fail a saving throw against a fear effect, you can reroll that saving throw once. If you still fail the saving throw, you suffer the fear effect for only half its duration, rounded down to a minimum of 0 rounds. Swiftness: For 12 hours, you gain a 20-foot enhancement bonus to speed in all movement types you have. Telepathy: You gain limited telepathy with a range of 30 feet, like that of a lashunta or shirren. If you already have limited telepathy, the adaptation grants you true telepathy. Either adaptation lasts 12 hours. During this time, you can also cast the 1st-level version of mind thrust as a spell-like ability up to three times. Weaponized Arm: One of your hands grows a macrergate mindspike or macrergate thresherblade, with which you are considered to be proficient. If necessary, the weapon integrates with your armor, functioning as with the wings of alate form. You can’t use the affected hand for other purposes, but neither can you be disarmed of the weapon. This adaptation lasts 4 hours, or until you detach the weapon as a standard action, then the weapon disintegrates.",

The time spent suppressed counts against an effect’s duration, and an item that uses battery charges still consumes those charges while suppressed. Void dust is sold by the pinch.

You wear the scanner on your head or headwear, wirelessly connected to your comm unit or eyewear. The assistant counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in your armor, taking up one upgrade slot. As a move action while wearing the assistant, you can cause the device to magically ping an area within a 60-foot spherical spread of you. Using this ping, the software creates a 3D reconstruction of the area, which it psychically projects to you and all creatures you consider allies in the affected area. This image adjusts to show each creature where it is in the image. The ping doesn’t sense through most objects, but it can sense through a closed door or window that isn’t airtight, hidden, or otherwise sealed. However, any starmetal in the structure of the door or window blocks this benefit. The ping can detect creatures and objects beyond your line of sight and places them as features on the map. Images of such creatures and objects are sometimes distorted, especially if they’re in motion. The infiltration assistant grants you and your allies in its area a +5 insight bonus to Perception checks to locate hidden creatures and doors within the mapped area. The bonus to find creatures applies only so long as those creatures remain in the same place. Creatures with ranks in Mysticism perceive the ping like a barely audible sound that raises goose bumps, and they can attempt a DC 25 Mysticism check to determine that something magical just happened. A creature concentrating on detect magic can sense the ping as a brief flash of magic, and a creature benefitting from arcane sight can see the ping as a literal flash of divination magic. An infiltration assistant can send out 10 pings per day. Each psychic image it produces lasts 5 rounds. As a move action, you can save the image on your comm unit or a similar device for later reference. This static image can provide you a map of the pinged area later without needing to ping it again, but it provides no bonus to Perception checks. Using the assistant creates magical resonance in creatures that benefit from it. Any creature that benefits from more than 10 pings in a given day experiences visual anomalies, becoming dazzled until after an uninterrupted 8-hour rest.",

However, if you place the gems over your own eyes, they burrow into your skull and replace two of your eyes (destroying the optic nerves of any additional eyes if you have more than two eyes), functioning as a long-range darkvision capacitors augmentation. You can still send out one eye as a spy drone, during which time the eyes do not grant you darkvision.

    "description": "Suspected to have been left behind by an ancient alien\ncivilization that abandoned its home planet sometime during\nthe Gap, a dimensional modulator looks like an asymmetrical\ncomputer with a display depicting several vertical columns\nof glowing digital runes that continuously morph and\nshift. The display is attached seamlessly to a cylindrical\nclockwork engine the approximate size and weight of a fire\nextinguisher, containing myriad ancient-looking cogs and\ngears incongruously integrated with more modern parts.\nA series of tuning forks of varying lengths, which protrude\nfrom the top of the apparatus, move when a large mechanical\ncrank affixed to one side is operated. Three times per day as\na standard action, you can aim the device at a single creature\nwithin 30 feet and turn the crank clockwise five full turns; this\nrequires the use of two hands. This causes the dimensional\nmodulator’s engine to generate bright flashes of energy, the\nsymbols on its display to change rapidly, and the\ntuning forks to spin, rise, and fall, emanating\nan eerie tone. The target must then\nsucceed at a DC 22 Fortitude save\nor be immediately transformed\ninto a two-dimensional\ncreature for 1d4 rounds.\nIf the target succeeds\nat the saving throw,\nthere is a 50% chance that you\nare affected by the dimensional\nmodulator instead. You must attempt the\nsame saving throw, but if you fail, you are transformed for\n1d6 rounds instead. Any creature that becomes two-dimensional in this way\nis perfectly flat and thin as paper, as if the creature is an\nanimated painting or living shadow. Any equipment a two-dimensional\ncreature is holding at the time of transformation\ntransforms with the creature. Such a creature can only move\nand take the combat banter action to speak. They can pass\nthrough other creatures’ spaces without provoking attacks\nof opportunity and can move along ceilings, floors, walls,\nand other flat surfaces as if affected by spider climb (though\nthey need not have any limbs free to do so) at double their\nnormal land speed. A two-dimensional creature can attempt\nPerception and Stealth checks, gaining a +10 circumstance\nbonus to Stealth checks if they move along a wall covered in\npaintings, graffiti, or other images. A two-dimensional creature\ncan still be the target of attacks, spells, and special abilities,\nbut they gain a +8 circumstance bonus to Armor Class, a +4\ncircumstance bonus to all saving throws, and DR 20/magic. If\na creature dies while two-dimensional, their image is etched\npermanently onto the flat surface where they perished. Some believe the aliens who created the dimensional\nmodulators are still alive today, having transformed\nthemselves into creatures perceived in more dimensions than\nmost denizens of the Pact Worlds can comprehend.",

    "description": "An Atrocite Sphere is a dull, dark globe 3 inches in diameter. Each of the several known Atrocite Spheres is thought to have spontaneously appeared from the void when an atrocite (a supernatural agent of the Devourer) emerged into the galaxy. The Atrocite Sphere must adjust to your soul by floating 3 inches above your head for 24 hours. If the sphere stops floating above you for more than 1 minute, it must readjust to you. The sphere can float above you while you’re prone or unconscious, but it stops doing so if you die. After it adjusts to you, the sphere exudes a slight pull, like gravity. While the Atrocite Sphere floats above you, you gain DR 10/— and energy resistance 10 against all energy types. If you gain a higher value in one of these defenses from another source, that value increases by 2. When it blocks damage, the sphere briefly flashes with crimson light that resembles a black hole’s accretion disc. When you take Hit Point damage from an attack or effect a foe created, as a reaction you can redirect some of the damage dealt to you. When you do so, the sphere flashes with crimson light and pulses with gravity, knocking you prone. Divide the damage dealt to you in half. If your attacker is within 330 feet of you, it takes this damage as force damage, is knocked prone, and suffers any critical effect the attack inflicted, but it suffers no other effects. The target can attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 20 + your Charisma modifier) to take half damage and avoid any critical effect. You take the remaining damage (though you get to apply your defenses to this damage normally). After you redirect damage with the Atrocite Sphere , you go berserk. This compulsion is a mind-affecting effect, but it works on any creature the sphere has adapted to, even if that creature is normally immune to such effects. While you are berserk, you gain a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls and a +3 morale bonus to damage rolls and Strength checks. You also gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to 3 times your level or CR, which remain only while you stay berserk. However, you take a –2 penalty to KAC and EAC. You can’t cast spells or use any skill or ability that requires concentration or patience. The only reactions you can take are attacks of opportunity. You consider no creature to be your ally, although you don’t consider erstwhile allies to be foes. On each of your turns while you’re berserk, you attack the opponent closest to you, moving or charging only if you need to do so to attack. You make a full attack if you can, using abilities or weapon special properties that facilitate making numerous attacks. When you make a full attack, you reduce the penalties for doing so by 1. If multiple opponents are equally close to you, you divide your attacks among them or include as many as you can in a full attack such as automatic fire. You cease being berserk if you lose consciousness or you’re aware of no other enemies. In addition, you can attempt a DC 25 Will saving throw each time you reduce a creature to 0 Hit Points, ending the berserking episode if you succeed. When the episode ends, you are fatigued for as long as you were berserk. If you fail to reduce a significant enemy to 0 Hit Points while you’re berserk, the Atrocite Sphere provides none of its benefits to you for 24 hours. An Atrocite Sphere can be destroyed only by being tossed into a star, gas giant, black hole, or some equally massive gravitational phenomenon. Cultists of the Devourer say this annihilation is useless, since the spheres will continue to be born until reality itself dies.",

According to legend, the book exists as a strange Material Plane connection to the Akashic Record, and information in the volume is presented through tactile means. However, the tome allows its readers to access information on only obscure topics. The axiomite curators of the library world of Athaeum have long sought this artifact as a capstone to their collection. If you can touch the Book of Unwritten Truths , you can read it. While you touch the book, you can take 20 on any skill check to recall knowledge, provided the DC to recall that knowledge is higher than 20. If you roll the check rather than taking 20, you gain a +10 insight bonus to the check. You can read the book to recall knowledge using any skill, even if you are untrained in the associated skill. Once you gain information from the check, the book closes itself and can’t be used to gain knowledge using the same skill for 24 hours. Once per day, the book allows you to cast vision . You must spend the 1 Resolve Point required for the spell, but you are considered to automatically succeed at the caster level check. The book, rather than a computer, imparts the information the spell accesses. If you attempt to use the book to research the Gap, you gain 1 negative level. Each time you use the book thereafter, you must succeed at a DC 30 Will saving throw or gain 1 negative level. Someone who knows a secret lost to the Gap can write that truth in the Book of Unwritten Truths to convert it to a mundane tome with none of its powers.",

    "name": "trafodi paradox",
    "description": "The Trafodi Paradox is an intricately carved orb of red stone or coral, a foot in diameter. The carving forms a multilayered lattice within the sphere. Despite its substance and size, the Trafodi Paradox is very light. During the conquest of Vesk-2, the vesk invaders ignored the pleas of the planet’s natives and ransacked the ancient vault containing the Trafodi Paradox . The inhabitants of Vesk- 2 had no written records of the sphere—only an oral legend that it was brought from the sky and sealed away during the Gap. A vesk warlord kept the artifact on Vesk-2, where it stayed for several generations before it came to the attention of high-ranking members of the Veskarium. The artifact was loaded onto a Veskarian military transport to be taken to Vesk Prime for further study. Distress signals recorded shortly thereafter indicate that vessel ran afoul of the Swarm, and no one has seen that starship or the Trafodi Paradox since. Those who have studied the accounts of Veskarian mystics who examined the artifact speculate that it is a transportation device but that it is either malfunctioning or designed for a truly alien and magically gifted species. As a full action that provokes attacks of opportunity, you can activate the Trafodi Paradox . The artifact darkens and shrinks as its internal lattice realigns. It activates just before the start of your next turn, provided you’re still conscious and holding the sphere. When you activate the Trafodi Paradox , it becomes a singularity in a square of your choice in your space or in a space adjacent to you. The singularity’s physical manifestation is tiny, but it is considered to occupy a 5-foot cube. When the singularity appears, creatures within 1 mile of the singularity feel drawn to it. A creature must succeed at a DC 25 Will save or use all its actions to move as quickly as possible toward the singularity. Although this is a mindaffecting effect, creatures immune to such effects still feel the pull and might seek the source of this attraction despite no compulsion to do so. Creatures within 120 feet of the singularity must succeed at a DC 25 Athletics check or a DC 20 Strength check to move farther from it, and even then does so at one-quarter its speed. Each round, at the start of your turn, the singularity performs a special combat maneuver with a +30 bonus to the attack roll. If a creature is within 120 feet of the singularity, compare the result of this attack roll to the creature’s KAC + 8. If the maneuver is successful, that creature moves 5 feet toward the singularity, plus 1 foot per point the singularity’s result exceeded the creature’s KAC + 8; round the distance up to the nearest 5 feet. Huge or smaller unattended objects move 30 feet toward the singularity at the start of each of your turns, moving an additional 10 feet per size category below Medium or 10 fewer feet per size category above Medium. A creature or object that enters the singularity’s space is sucked into the void. While inside, a creature can take no actions other than a full action to escape, which requires a successful DC 30 Athletics check or DC 25 Strength check. A creature that ends its turn inside the singularity takes 5d10 force damage unless it succeeds at a DC 20 Will save to take half damage; if it succeeds by 5 or more, the creature negates the damage entirely. The creature that activated the artifact gains a +5 circumstance bonus to this saving throw. The amount of damage dealt by the void increases by 5d10 each round. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 Hit Points, the creature’s body is utterly destroyed. A creature that succeeds at a Will save within the singularity senses a presence in the void. In myriad voices, one of which the listener can understand, the presence offers salvation from the crushing gravity. A creature that accepts this salvation leaves the void, transported to another location in the galaxy or among the planes. Upon escaping in this way, a creature regains half of the Hit Points it lost to the singularity. Escapees with strong emotional attachments to one another often arrive in the same location, while enemies rarely land in the same place. The singularity created by the Trafodi Paradox lasts 13 minutes. When the singularity ends, the artifact disappears. Roll 1d20 as the control and 1d20 as the determiner. If the determiner is higher than the control, the Trafodi Paradox reappears in the possession of the creature that last activated it. Otherwise, the artifact could reappear anywhere in the galaxy. The creature that last activated the artifact can sense in which direction the artifact lies, provided the object isn’t sealed in an area lined with starmetal. The Trafodi Paradox can be destroyed only if it consumes the last member of the species that created it.",

    "name": "ungarato",
    "description": "Ungarato is one of the most powerful known relics of lost Golarion, though even greater artifacts have occasionally appeared throughout Absalom Station’s history. Ungarato , also called the All-Consuming Killer or the Gun of Gluttony , is known to be one of the Alara’hai , seven weapons of nearly divine magical power that were also referred to as the Seven Blades of Conviction or the Seven Swords of Sin . Although the fates of the other six Alara’hai remain unknown, these epithets imply that Ungarato was once a sword of some kind, though when, how, and why this blade was reforged into a powerful machine gun with a bayonet is one of the relic’s greatest mysteries. Much of Ungarato’s history is lost, though scholars have shown that the weapon was created in its original form thousands of years before the Gap. The Arcanamirium’s most learned esotericists agree that Ungarato’s origin lies in ancient Thassilon, an empire ruled by spellcasting tyrants called runelords, which collapsed at the beginning of the period of Golarion’s history known as the Age of Darkness. It is also generally agreed that the weapon’s intended wielder was the Runelord of Gluttony, but a ferocious warrior stole the blade before it ever reached the runelord’s hands. This barbarian warlord later became the champion of the runelord’s successor, and it is believed that Ungarato took its name from this champion. Nothing definitive is known of Ungarato’s fate after the fall of Thassilon. Ungarato has a distinct appearance that is unlike any other specific model of longarm. It has a misty, spectral quality, but the weapon is as solid as any other. Ungarato functions as a paragon X-gen gun, and its bayonet is a molecular rift dueling sword, both of which have the ghost killer fusion. Two hands are required to wield Ungarato , and proficiency with basic melee weapons and heavy weapons is necessary to use the weapon without penalty for melee and ranged attacks, respectively. Ungarato glows with a bright, sickly green color whenever there is a creature of the undead type within 50 feet of its wielder, though the weapon gives no indication of the direction or number of undead within that range. Each time its wielder suffers the full effects of a critical hit (when damage reduction, energy resistance, or some other effect does not reduce the damage dealt or prevent any critical hit effect), Ungarato gains 1 point of viciousness. Whenever Ungarato scores a critical hit, it automatically spends 1 point of viciousness (if it has any) and adds the severe wound critical hit effect to the critical damage dealt. Any unused points of viciousness fade at the rate of 1 per hour. Ungarato also restores 10 Hit Points to its wielder (functioning as per mystic cure ) each time it scores a critical hit (whether or not it has any points of viciousness). Ungarato is a unique artifact of extreme power and legendary reputation; as such, the weapon is effectively priceless and cannot simply be purchased. Indeed, its current owner and whereabouts are unknown, though Ungarato is widely believed to have resurfaced recently somewhere on Absalom Station. Legend claims that Ungarato was once sentient and held great powers that only functioned in the hands of a Thassilonian runelord, but there’s no modern evidence to support either claim. Similarly, it is believed that only the rightful Runelord of Gluttony can break the weapon; Ungarato is otherwise impervious to damage or destruction.",

As a move action, you can squeeze the seed to activate it and hold it or drop it in a square within your reach. Alternatively, as a standard action, you can squeeze and throw the seed (range increment 20 feet) as a ranged attack targeting a square (AC 5). At the end of the turn in which you activate the seed, it erupts into thick vines in the square it’s in, as well as all squares within 10 feet of the first. This area becomes difficult terrain. A creature caught in the vines must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 14 + your key ability score modifier) or become entangled. An entangled creature can escape as a move action with a successful Acrobatics check or Strength check at the same DC. The vines last and renew themselves for 5 rounds; if the seed lands on a surface made of a material in which plants can’t normally grow, the vines last for only 2 rounds.

Many different Blackraven axes from pre-Gap Golarion have been found, and all are basic melee weapons with the archaic special property. A Blackraven axe typically has a head shaped like a raven’s beak or a stylized raven inscribed on its blade, and it has the ability to cause its targets to burst into flames—a quality that proved especially useful against the trolls the original Blackravens faced. Modern spellcasters have recreated this magic as the burning weapon fusion. Modern Blackraven axes are often created by applying the burning weapon fusion to a tactical battleaxe. A tactical battleaxe is a 5th-level, one-handed advanced melee weapon that deals 1d8 slashing damage and has the wound critical hit effect. It has the analog special property, has 1 bulk, and costs 2,650 credits. A tactical Blackraven axe is presented in the table on page 50, and the price includes both the weapon and the fusion.",

They were most commonly employed by a group called the Steel Falcons, a branch of the Eagle Knights of the Golarion nation of Andoran, and they were apparently designed for use specifically on sailing ships. As a move action while wearing falcon boots , you can set your own personal, local gravity to be perpendicular to any adjacent surface able to support your weight under normal gravity conditions. This personal gravity effect only functions in normal gravity or lower. While this personal gravity is active, you gain a climb speed equal to your land speed, and if knocked prone, you fall in accordance with your personal gravity (thus falling prone in your space, even if that is on a wall or ceiling, rather than falling toward the ground as defined by the environment’s normal gravity conditions). If you drop an item while your falcon boots are active, it also falls in your space. If you move from that square before picking up a dropped item, the item becomes subject to normal gravity. If you are not adjacent to a surface able to support your weight, your falcon boots cease to function and you are subject to normal gravity. You can also deactivate falcon boots as a move action.

    "description": "When not in use, storage goo is a ball of slightly luminous putty, 6 inches in diameter, with the consistency of soft chewing gum. Skittermander mystics concocted this goo long ago as a novelty. The stuff’s usefulness, especially for smuggling, has seen its manufacture spread throughout the Veskarium and across known space. As a standard action, you can squeeze the goo to activate it. If the goo isn’t storing any items, this causes it to glow with blue light and remain active for up to 1 minute. While the goo is active, you can store up to 1 bulk of objects within it without changing the goo’s shape or size, as the objects appear to be deconstructed into blue light. You can store analog one-handed melee weapons, tools, and other simple objects, provided the objects are no more complex than analog melee weapons and require no power. If you activate goo that has stored objects inside, those objects reemerge, almost as if they’re being reconstructed in a display of blue light. If you’re holding the goo when the objects reemerge, you can have as many reappear in your hands as you have hands free, and the rest fall to the ground in your space. Once the goo releases stored objects, it turns to dust.",

    "description": "Millennia ago, an enterprising guild of azer mystics discovered\nhow to weave garments entirely out of planar essence from\nthe Plane of Fire. This newfound fashion of flickering flames\nwas dubbed infernowear . It wasn’t long before the same azers\nfigured out how to make similar clothes interwoven with planar\nfabrics from each of the Elemental Planes, creating garments of\nshifting sands, roiling snowfalls, or writhing lightning (dubbed dustwear , blizzardwear , and boltwear , respectively). These\ncrafting techniques were thought to be lost during the Gap until\nan environmental scientist and amateur tailor found examples of\nthese garments at the Brass Bazaar in the Burning Archipelago.\nShe was able to reproduce these garments and began selling\nthem under the general name of weatherwear , though the items\nhave an unfortunate side effect, as detailed below. Each type of weatherwear can be integrated into any style\nof nonmagical clothing, granting\nthe benefits of that clothing in addition to its own benefits,\nthough weatherwear must be worn over armor and you can\nwear only one type of weatherwear at a time. While wearing\na specific type of weatherwear, you gain resistance 5 to the\nenergy damage type associated with the garment’s elemental\nfabric (acid for dustwear , cold for blizzardwear , electricity for boltwear , and fire for infernowear ). In addition, once per day,\nyou can reroll a failed saving throw that would result in you\ntaking energy damage of the corresponding type. However, if\nyou roll a 1 on that second saving throw, you lose the provided\nenergy resistance and instead gain vulnerability to that energy\ntype for 1 minute.",

The common characteristic of all Thruneblades is their spellbane critical hit effect, though many such weapons have additional magic abilities, such as the unholy weapon fusion.

They created calcification rods , idealistically, to perfectly preserve objects of natural history that might otherwise rot away. Such rods see use well beyond Kalo-Mahoi, whether by scholars of natural history or those with less scrupulous aims. An authentic Kalo-Mahoian calcification rod is a rough shaft of coral that glows at the end that touches a chosen target. As a standard action, you can touch a calcification rod to a nonmagical object made of once-living matter, including a corpse. If the object fits into a 10-foot cube, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 14 + your key ability score modifier) or turn to stone. If a creature holds or wears the target object, that creature can use its own Fortitude save bonus in place of the object’s. Alternatively, you can use the rod as a club (which counts as magic for the purpose of bypassing DR), or you can attempt to touch a creature with the rod by making an attack against its EAC. If your attack hits a creature that is living or made of once-living matter, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (at the same DC) or move one step further along the Dexterity poison track. While under this effect, a creature can attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn each round, curing the affliction with one successful save. A creature that would reach the dead state is instead affected as if it had failed its saving throw against a flesh to stone spell, except it can attempt a new saving throw once every 24 hours to end the affliction. Any target that is immune to petrification is immune to this rod’s effects.",

A mask of the mantis replaces a suit of armor’s normal helmet (if any) and is incorporated into the armor’s normal environmental protections; these protections do not function if the helm is removed. If the armor has an available upgrade slot, a mask of the mantis takes up one upgrade slot; otherwise, the mask counts as one of your two worn magic items. While wearing a mask of the mantis , you gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet. In addition, a mask of the mantis has 2 daily charges. As a standard action, you can expend 1 charge to gain either the effects of see invisibility (as per the spell) for 30 minutes or a +3 insight bonus to Perception checks for 30 minutes. Both of these effects can be active simultaneously, and each charge is replenished 24 hours after being used.",

These rods appeared during the Gap, likely created by spellcasters as an answer to rapidly expanding technology. As a standard action, you can touch a techbane rod to an unattended technological or hybrid item, weapon, or armor. If such an object fits inside a 10-foot cube, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 14 + your key ability score modifier) or its functions are suppressed for 1d4 rounds. If a creature is holding or wearing the object, you must succeed at a melee attack roll against the creature’s EAC to hit the target object. Alternatively, if a creature is wearing the object, you can use the techbane rod as a club (which counts as magic for the purpose of overcoming DR) to hit the wearer and the target object. If your attack hits, the object must attempt a Fortitude saving throw as normal, but the bearer can use its Fortitude save bonus in place of the object’s. You can instead touch the rod to a creature that has the technological subtype, targeting EAC, or you can use the rod as a magic club against such a creature. If your attack hits, the creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (at the same DC) or become staggered and unable to use energy-based attacks for 1d4 rounds. A creature can attempt a new Fortitude saving throw at the end of its turn each round to end the effect early.",

If the puck is viewed with detect magic , runic patterns become visible on the puck’s surface. As a standard action, you can activate the puck and throw it (range increment 30 feet) as a ranged attack targeting a square (AC 5). If the puck is within 120 feet of you after you throw it, you can teleport to the puck’s location as a move action, carrying objects up to your maximum capacity. You can also bring up to two willing or unconscious Medium or smaller creatures (or one willing or unconscious Large creature) with you, provided that all creatures that teleport in this way are touching at least one other creature that teleports at the same time. If you arrive in a place that is already occupied by a solid body, you and all creatures traveling with you each take 1d6 force damage and are shunted to a random open space on a suitable surface within 10 feet of the puck’s location. If no such space exists within 10 feet, you and all creatures traveling with you each take 1d6 additional force damage and are shunted to an appropriate space within 30 feet. If no such space exists within 30 feet, you and all creatures traveling with you each take 2d6 additional force damage and the teleportation fails. Any creature that occupies the destination space and causes the teleportation to fail takes half the damage you do. Once thrown, the puck remains active either until you successfully teleport to it or until 5 rounds have passed. It then becomes a nonmagical object that can’t be used to teleport again.",

Each anvil consists of a heavy iron block anchored to a 5-foot-diameter stone base engraved with magical runes and symbols. Anvils of Torag are much prized by dwarf collectors and the crafting guilds of dwarven star citadels, as the anvils are seen as a tangible link to Torag, the patron god of the dwarves, who disappeared during the Gap. While non-dwarf collectors often consider an anvil of Torag too precious to use, most dwarves think it’s ridiculous to have a crafting relic and not actually use it. An anvil of Torag aids in crafting equipment and magic items. If you use an anvil of Torag while crafting an item, you are considered to have 2 additional ranks in the appropriate crafting skill, allowing you to craft items of higher level than you would normally be able to create. A given anvil of Torag can be used to craft only one item per day. Due its bulk and size, an anvil of Torag is generally not portable and must be properly anchored before use. An anvil of Torag can be installed on a starship in an arcane laboratory, a cargo hold, or a tech workshop, or it can be placed anywhere with room to store a Large vehicle.",

Before the Gap, it was common for soothsayers and explorers to depend on the cloaks for the visions of the future that came to them in their sleep. Modern artificers have learned to make such cloaks by imbuing artificial fabrics with oils derived from transdimensional pesh. While wearing a dreamsilk cloak , you can see details in hallucinations and illusions that others overlook. This does not give you any bonus to saving throws against illusions, but if you successfully disbelieve an illusion and convey the fact that it is an illusion to others, they gain a +6 bonus to their saving throws to disbelieve, rather than the normal +4. Additionally, if you wear a dreamsilk cloak for an uninterrupted period of at least 16 hours and then sleep for at least 8 additional hours while still wearing it, you have a vivid, prophetic dream. Although the meaning of the dream isn’t immediately obvious when you wake up, you can learn more as the day progresses. Once during the next 24 hours, you can cast augury as a spell-like ability, using your character level as your caster level.",

Many can be traced back to Citadel Gheradesca, the ancient fortress headquarters of the Order of the Chain, where they were given out as rewards to members of the order who brought particularly high-value fugitives back to face legal consequences. Traditionally, a Hellknight flail was a basic melee weapon with the archaic special property that had heavy iron chains affixed to the haft of the weapon. After the Gap, various Hellknight orders discovered instructions for the creation of Hellknight flails among their carefully archived records. As a result, modern Hellknights have recreated Hellknight flails by applying the binding and chained weapon fusions to batons and similar weapons. Order of the Chain Hellknights frequently use Hellknight flails , as do Hellknights of other orders, as well as other law enforcement agents and bounty hunters unaffiliated with the Hellknights, though to a lesser extent. The Hellknight flail presented in the table on page 50 is an incapacitator with the binding and chained fusions, and the price includes both the weapon and the fusions.",

An inspiration blazon is a decorated medal or tabard that lets you lend your allies your Resolve. An inspiration blazon must be worn prominently to function. When an ally within 60 feet of you spends Resolve Points, as a reaction while you are wearing an inspiration blazon , you can activate the blazon to inspire that ally, provided that you can see and be heard by the ally. You speak words of encouragement and spend up to 2 Resolve Points to reduce the number of Resolve Points your ally spends by the amount you spent, to a minimum of 0. The blazon has no effect on an ally who has no Resolve Points. An inspiration blazon can’t affect a given ally again until that ally regains Resolve Points during an 8-hour rest.",

If you throw the bead through a narrow opening, your attack roll must equal or exceed the opening’s AC (10 for a narrow opening or 15 for an extremely narrow one) to avoid hitting the side and detonating the bead prematurely. When the bead strikes a hard surface, it explodes in a 20-foot radius, dealing electricity and fire damage according to its type, as shown on the table below. A target that succeeds at a Reflex save (see the table) takes only half damage. Once you detach a bead, it loses its magic if it hasn’t exploded after 5 rounds. If the necklace isn’t worn, detached beads immediately become nonmagical.",

A flux fig always transforms you into a species of your creature type that has racial traits for player characters, though exactly which species is determined randomly by the GM. Flux figs have no effect on constructs, outsiders, or undead. You recalculate your ability scores from scratch using your new racial traits (remembering to include any ability score increases from leveling up). Upon awakening, you lose any former racial traits and gain new racial traits. You retain your personality, memories, augmentations, class features, feats, and skill ranks. You can’t change any choices made during prior character advancement, and you must still meet any prerequisites of equipment, feats, and other player options to be able to use those options.

    "description": "A phase twin generator is a pistol-like device composed of ever-shifting components that appear as black crystalline prisms laced with light-blue lines. As a standard action, you can make a ranged attack with the phase twin generator (which counts as a small arm) against a living creature, targeting EAC, with a range increment of 30 feet. If the attack hits, the phase twin generator generates a ghostly, incorporeal version of the target, known as a phase twin, in a space adjacent to you (if there is no such space available, the phase twin generator does not generate the phase twin). The phase twin has all the statistics of the creature it was generated from, except it has the incorporeal special ability, it is mindless, it has no speeds except for a land speed of 5 feet, and it has Hit Points equal to one-quarter of the target’s maximum Hit Points. The phase twin acts on the initiative count of the creature it was generated from, and it cannot take any actions other than one move action to move its speed per turn, which it uses to move toward the creature it was generated from, if possible. Whenever the phase twin takes damage from an effect that does not also damage the target creature, the target creature also takes that amount of damage as force damage. A phase twin lasts either for 10 rounds or until the target creature dies, whichever comes first, after which it dissipates. A phase twin generator can generate a phase twin only once per day, and a creature can be affected by only one phase twin generator per day.",

When you play a shantak whistle for 1 minute, its song reaches out to the stars, and within 1d6 hours, a single shantak arrives at your location. Once it arrives, a shantak is under no magical compulsion to serve you, but you gain a +10 circumstance bonus to skill checks to secure the shantak’s service as a mount (at the GM’s discretion, usually requiring Diplomacy or Intimidate) for one Large or smaller creature. Even a shantak compelled to serve as a mount usually refuses to participate in battle and is likely to cooperate only long enough for a one-way trip using its spaceflight ability. A shantak whistle can be used only once every 2 weeks.",

You can hold a psychic inhibitor in one hand and activate it once per day as a standard action by picturing a complex series of geometric shapes in your mind. When you do so, each creature with the limited telepathy or telepathy ability within 100 feet (including yourself) must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your key ability score modifier) or have their mind flooded with unbearable psychic noise. Each affected creature loses its limited telepathy or telepathy ability and takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls, a –4 penalty to Will saving throws, and a –8 penalty to Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skills for 1 hour. This is a mind-affecting effect. A creature that succeeds at its save can’t be affected by the same psychic inhibitor for 1 week. A psychic inhibitor comes with four attuned psychic disinhibitors (these are created at the same time as the psychic inhibitor and are included in the price). A psychic disinhibitor is a flexible disk 1 inch in diameter that can be affixed to a creature’s skin (preferably near the brain) to make the creature immune to the attuned psychic inhibitor’s effects.

Alternatively, as a standard action, you can command the tesseract to release a creature within it. The released creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or become helpful toward you for 1 hour. A creature that succeeds at the saving throw acts according to its normal inclinations and desires. A containment tesseract accepts commands only twice per day.",

A wily duelist might wear a ring of counterspells to foil one of an opponent’s tricks, though these rings also work well against enemies who employ predictable offensive magic. A spellcaster can target a ring of counterspells with a spell. That spell has no effect other than being stored in the ring. While you wear the ring, if you would be a target of the spell stored in the ring, the spell fails and has no effect. This countering is automatic; it requires no action or awareness on your part. Once the ring counters a spell, the stored spell dissipates, and the ring can’t counter a spell until another is stored within it.",

    "name": "ring of the ninth truth",
    "description": "A rare velstrac item that neither causes nor relies on pain, a ring of the ninth truth is a prize to anyone seeking insight or personal enlightenment. The ring’s guidance is accurate, but it is often cryptic, utterly amoral, and rarely safe. A ring of the ninth truth functions as a mk 3 ring of resistance. It also gives you powers of prescience. Once per day, you can enter a trance for 1 minute and focus on your planned actions in the immediate future, gaining an intuitive insight into the results of your actions with regard to your personal values and goals. You learn whether your course might be beneficial to you, harmful to you, both, or neither. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge this power, but the ring can be used this way no more than three times per day. In addition, once per week, you can enter a similar trance for 10 minutes and spend 1 Resolve Point, seeking insight into a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within the next week. You receive an enigmatic and unsettling vision pertaining to your query. This vision always contains useful hints that can guide your steps toward the chosen event or goal. Any mortal using a ring of the ninth truth eventually attracts the notice of velstracs. The form this attention takes is often subtle, augmenting the ring’s ministrations with fiendish aid intended to usher the wearer down the path of darkness. Rumors speak of rings of this sort that allow a wearer to safely contact a mighty velstrac, as if using contact other plane , with the price of reciprocating that velstrac’s aid.",

The detonator can be set to ignite its payload with the simple press of a button (no action), a four-digit command code (a move action), or a complex input method, such as scanning your retina or thumbprint (a full action). You choose the triggering method when setting the detonator. A detonator detonates its payload only if it is within 500 feet, but some detonators can make use of signal-boosting technologies at the risk of becoming vulnerable to countermeasures like signal jammers and other effects. Explosives have the same price, effect, and weight as grenades (see page 183). If you successfully set an explosive on a stationary object with a detonator using the Engineering skill, the explosive’s damage ignores half of the object’s hardness.",

Datapads can record simple audio and video (though not in high enough resolution to serve as proof of recorded events in most courts of law), store thousands of hours of recordings, play games, track time and set time-based alarms, act as word processors, and perform numerous other minor data processing and entertainment functions. All datapads have light bulk, and most are tier 1 computers with the miniaturization upgrade. Tier 2 and higher datapads are generally used only by the wealthy elites or technological sophisticates due to the additional miniaturization technology involved, but they are more powerful than many stationary computers while still fitting comfortably in one hand. Datapads can have computer modules and countermeasures installed at the usual additional costs. For example, most datapads in military or industrial use have the hardened upgrade. Saboteurs and spies frequently disguise eavesdropping devices or explosives as ordinary datapads, knowing that the datapads’ universal use means they won’t raise suspicion.",

    "description": "This smooth, thumb-sized device activates automatically when it is inside a living creature. You can implant a diagnostic lozenge subdermally in a willing or unconscious creature with a successful DC 20 Medicine check, or a creature can choose to swallow one. An activated diagnostic lozenge steers itself into a creature’s tissue and extrudes several filaments to monitor its status, broadcasting information on a predetermined wireless frequency to a designated receiver, such as a datapad or comm unit, as long as the receiver is within 1 mile of the lozenge. The diagnostic lozenge broadcasts the creature’s direction and distance relative to the receiver, as well as any of the following conditions that are affecting the creature: dead, dying, frightened, nauseated, panicked, sickened, stable, staggered, stunned, or unconscious. A single receiver can accept information from up to six different diagnostic lozenges simultaneously. When a diagnostic lozenge runs out of charges, it breaks down into harmless components that eventually pass out of the creature’s body. Diagnostic lozenges can’t normally be safely removed once activated.",

    "description": "Crafted of chemicals found on sweltering jungle worlds, this dull-brown cylindrical unit is no larger than a datapad. When an evenfire unit is activated, an electric current causes the chemicals to emit steady heat, but not light, within a 30-foot radius. Over 1 minute, the temperature of this area increases by 60° F, to a maximum of 80° F. The effects of multiple active evenfire units do not stack. This heat dissipates once the unit is shut off. An evenfire’s heat is consistent throughout the area and is no hotter closer to the unit than at the edge of its area of effect. Anyone in the heated area gains a +2 circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves against environmental cold dangers. In moderate or strong winds, an evenfire’s temperature increase is reduced to 30° F, and the circumstance bonus to Fortitude saves is reduced to +1. In severe or stronger winds, an evenfire unit provides no temperature increase or save bonus.",

    "name": "grappler",
    "description": "A grappler is a high-tech anchoring device that can be attached to a cable line as a move action. The cable line can instead be threaded through the grappler, which takes 1 minute but adds the cable line’s hardness and HP to the hardness and HP of the grappler (and vice versa). A grappler has clamps that can slide from its base along a cable line attached to it, allowing it to be climbed as easily as a knotted rope (see Athletics on page 136). You can attach a grappler through which a cable line is threaded to an immobile object that’s at least 5 feet in width with a ranged attack against AC 5. If the grappler is fired at a moving object or a smaller object, you must hit that object’s KAC + 8 to attach the grappler to the object. After it’s attached, the grappler remains anchored until either you give a release command as a move action, the grappler is pried free with an Athletics check equal to the attack roll you made to attach it, or the grappler is destroyed. If a cable line attached to or threaded through a grappler is destroyed but the grappler itself was not damaged, the cable line is destroyed, but the grappler is unharmed. In this case, the grappler loses the excess hardness and HP that a threaded cable line added to it. You can also target a creature with the grappler. This is resolved as a grapple combat maneuver, but a creature struck with the grappler can still use its hands, and its movement is only restricted to remain within range of the length of the grappler’s cable. In addition to the normal rules for escaping a grapple, the target can pry itself loose with a successful Athletics check (DC equal to your attack roll to grapple the target). Or, it can perform a sunder combat maneuver (see page 246) against the grappler. Even if the combat maneuver doesn’t destroy the attached cable, the creature escapes the grapple. A grappler can be thrown as a grenade or set over the muzzle of a ranged weapon that targets KAC, in which case it has half the normal range increment of the weapon, and you use any weapon proficiency and bonuses to attack you have with that weapon. A grappler can be reused.",

Taking off a holoshroud is a move action, or you can take off the holoshroud as part of the move action to stand up from a prone position. A creature with the blindsense ability ignores the effect of a holoshroud. You cannot hide under a holoshroud that is not activated; if the holoshroud runs out of charges while you are underneath it, you are visible as normal. You can spend 1 minute covering a Medium or smaller object with a holoshroud, making it appear to be a natural part of the surrounding terrain. For example, you can conceal a hoverbike as a rock or patch of brush. Covering a Large object requires two holoshrouds. Covering a Huge or Gargantuan object requires five holoshrouds and takes 10 minutes of work. Camouflaging a Colossal object depends on its shape but generally requires at least 10 holoshrouds and takes 1 hour of work. The DC of Perception checks to notice or search for an object covered by a holoshroud is increased by 10. Any creature within 10 feet of a Large or larger object hidden by holoshrouds automatically recognizes it as a camouflaged object.",

    "name": "ion tape",
    "description": "Ion tape is a ribbon of material tightly wound around a spindle. A roll of ion tape fits in the palm of a human hand and comes in a wide range of colors. A single roll contains 50 feet of tape. A single strip of tape is easy to cut through or tear. It has a weak adhesive that keeps the tape in place when wrapped around an object. When ion tape is exposed to an electrical charge of any power (including a jolt from a zipstick), the tape bonds into a single mass of plastic-like material, gaining hardness 8 and 15 Hit Points. When used to bind a creature, a few strips of activated ion tape require a successful DC 28 Strength check to break. A second jolt from an electrical source causes the tape to revert to its weaker ribbon state, at which point it can be torn easily. A strip of ion tape can hold about 5 pounds of weight normally, but when activated via a jolt, a single hardened strip can support up to 300 pounds. The uses for ion tape are many: it can be used to construct basic objects (such as a ladder), patch holes, bind prisoners, and so on.",

Further grinding produces polyfluid that flows into a swappable tank that itself weighs 1 bulk empty. Polyfluid can be gleaned from both analog and technological items. In any case, the material you produce is worth 10% of the original item’s value. The weight of the polyfluid produced is determined by that monetary value. A portable grinder requires a battery.

You activate a sleeping sentry by leaning back into the exoskeletal harness, allowing it to gently lock you into a standing position while supporting your neck, spine, legs, and arms. The automated medical unit then injects you with a cocktail of barbiturates that puts you instantly to sleep for the next 8 hours (or until awoken by the sleeping sentry); an unwilling creature forced into the harness can attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save to remain conscious. Shortly thereafter, antigravitry circuitry within the disc activates, suspending the entire structure approximately 1 inch off the ground and moving along a preprogrammed patrol route at a speed of 20 feet. The disc can move over land and over water, but not underwater. Creatures who come within 30 feet of an activated sleeping sentry must succeed at a DC 25 Stealth check to fool the sleeping sentry’s motion detectors, or else an integrated high-frequency proximity alarm sounds, waking you and releasing you from the harness to confront the threat. Any creature that is more than 30 feet away from a sleeping sentry must succeed at a DC 22 Perception check to recognize its occupant is asleep or a DC 20 Engineering check to identify the device.",

    "description": "A thief drone is a specialized version of a basic domestic drone . When activated, this Tiny drone acts as the hover drone of a 1st-level mechanic, and you control it as if you were a 1st-level mechanic (using either an included remote control or a computer with an added control), except it has the smuggler’s compartment drone mod instead of a weapons mount. The thief drone can’t make any attacks and has no feats and no ability to add drone mods beyond those specified in this entry. An activated thief drone can move its speed, but it can otherwise take only the actions specified in this description. A thief drone can understand one language (chosen at purchase), but it cannot speak. Some criminals disguise their thief drones to resemble ordinary drones, which allows these illegal models to blend in without raising suspicion. If an activated thief drone is accessible to a creature attempting an Engineering check to disable a lock, that creature reduces the DC of the Engineering check by 5. Alternatively, the thief drone can attempt to disable a lock on its own with a –5 penalty. Its skill unit is Engineering. A thief drone has a usage of 1/hour with a capacity of 20. A thief drone can be upgraded with any two of the following technological items by paying 125% of the item’s price: grappler, glass cutter, tool kit (hacking), or x-ray visor. The price of buying and installing an upgrade includes the price of replacing an old upgrade on a drone, if applicable.",

A blabbersponder’s case is\nfilled with a compact array of microsensors (often composed of\ninubrix) connected to a miniaturized computer (treat as a tier 0\ncomputer equipped with a control module) that, bolstered by\na signal booster, analyzes and actively transmits a starship’s\nvital data to another source. While no astute starship captain\nwould ever install a blabbersponder on their own ship, such\ndevices are often sold in gray markets to saboteurs serving\nthe whims of corporations, or bounty hunters who wish to\ngain vital information about a specific starship’s defenses.\nSome clever pirates of the Diaspora are also rumored to sell\nblabbersponders to gullible spacefarers by offering them as\nupgrades to starship communication systems. They then use\nthe data they collect from the device to determine if the cargo,\ndefenses, weapons, and crew aboard the ship warrant the\neffort of intercepting and ambushing it later. To install a blabbersponder on a starship computer, you\nmust succeed at an Engineering check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2\n× the starship’s tier). Once installed and activated, the\nblabbersponder’s internal computer uses its control module\nto automatically hack into the computer it’s attached to.\nThe control module reads and broadcasts all data related to\nthe starship’s systems, allowing any science officer aboard\nanother starship within passive sensor range of the blabbersponder’s ship to use the scan\naction on that vessel, even if the two ships aren’t engaged in\nstarship combat. Because of the detailed information provided\nby the blabbersponder, the science officer performing this\nscan action gains a +5 circumstance bonus to the associated\nComputers check, and the broadcasting ship doesn’t add the\nbonus from its defensive countermeasures to the DC. Detecting that a blabbersponder is in fact an instrument\nof sabotage and not a benign technological device before it\nis installed requires a successful DC 25 Engineering or DC 30\nPerception check. Discovering an installed blabbersponder\naboard a starship requires a successful DC 28 Computers\ncheck. When an installed blabbersponder’s battery is\ndepleted, it recharges itself using the starship’s power core in\na process that takes about 5 minutes; on the day this occurs,\nyou receive a +2 circumstance bonus to the Computers check\nto notice the sudden, short surge in power use and discover\nthe blabbersponder on your vessel. Once discovered, a\nblabbersponder can be easily unplugged.",

    "description": "This vicious-looking clawed wand is used to detect and quickly remove foreign objects from under the skin. You can use the subdermal extractor only on an unconscious or willing target. The clawed end of the subdermal extractor contains a delicate sensor that evaluates the target’s genetic material and scans for foreign objects (including alien eggs, biotech and cybernetic augmentations, tracking chips, etc.). To detect an anomalous object, you take a move action and must succeed at a Computers or Medicine check with a DC equal to 15 or 10 + the level of the implanted item, whichever is higher. If the implanted material was injected as part of a creature’s attack, the DC is instead 15 + the CR of the attacking creature. As a standard action, you can deploy the subdermal extractor to remove anomalous material you have detected. This typically requires a successful DC 25 Medicine check, but this DC might be lower or higher at the GM’s discretion (such as if the item is particularly small or if it has woven itself into the target’s interior physiology). Whether or not you succeed or fail at the check, the target takes 1d6 slashing damage from the attempt. Each detection attempt uses a charge from the subdermal extractor, as does each removal attempt. You can use a subdermal extractor on yourself, but the DCs of skill checks to use it are increased by 2. Although a subdermal extractor can be used to quickly remove cybernetics or other augmentations, only the most disreputable back-alley shops use subdermal extractors for this purpose, and such augmentations still can’t be resold.",

Two thin earpieces extend from the band to slip unobtrusively into your ears once the mouthpiece is donned. When created, an envoy’s mouthpiece is encoded with one specific language. Whenever the language is spoken within 30 feet of you, the mouthpiece translates that language into Common. In addition, any words you speak in Common are transformed by the mouthpiece into the encoded language, allowing conversation to take place between you and speakers of the encoded language. An envoy’s mouthpiece cannot be used to translate languages other than the one it has been programmed to translate, although devices that translate into languages other than Common do exist. An envoy’s mouthpiece automatically records any words it translates, allowing anything translated through the device to be replayed through its earpiece at the touch of a button located on the lower right side. Up to 10 continuous hours can be recorded in this manner. Holding the button down for a full round erases any currently stored conversations.",

When the activated wire is moved or touched, the cylinder emits a piercing alarm (though you can set it to send a silent alarm wirelessly to a comm unit or datapad instead). Noticing the warning wire requires a successful Perception check with a DC equal to 20 + the level of the warning wire, and bypassing it without setting it off usually requires a successful Acrobatics check at the same DC, though the GM might adjust the DC higher or lower as circumstances dictate. You can twist the cylinder in a preset pattern as a move action, deactivating the alarm and respooling the wire around the cylinder.",

    "description": "This handheld holographic display unit has an underslung rack housing dozens of miniaturized flying microbots. When you activate the autocartographer, you pick a grid intersection within 50 feet to which you have line of effect. The microbots scatter in a 100-foot cube, scanning the environment and sending data back to the display unit for aggregation and analysis. The microbots transmit the dimensions and basic layout of rooms, corridors, and sizable natural features, including large furnishings. Their sensors ignore living creatures, fine details (such as images on computer screens), and temporary magical effects, but they record permanent ones, including illusory obstacles. They can’t differentiate between illusions or holograms and real objects. The microbots’ data is sent by a wireless signal and is therefore vulnerable to countermeasures such as signal jammers. Individual microbots are small enough to pass through any opening at least an inch wide. They can operate both in air or vacuum, but heavy gravity or strong or stronger winds overwhelm their delicate propulsion systems and render them inactive. The microbots emit a distinctive whir and can be detected with a successful DC 15 Perception check. One minute after you release the microbots, the autocartographer displays a composite map showing all features within the scanned 100-foot cube as a three-dimensional holographic image, and the microbots return to the unit. You can save these images in a data file that can be displayed later, although you need to rescan an area to obtain updated information, such as opened doors or repositioned furniture. Each file is tagged with global or astronomical positioning data, allowing you to connect multiple maps in space and scroll between them.",

The wire is often wrapped around valuable belongings or stretched as a trip wire across a doorway. When the activated wire is moved or touched, the cylinder emits a piercing alarm (though you can set it to send a silent alarm wirelessly to a comm unit or datapad instead). Noticing the warning wire requires a successful Perception check with a DC equal to 20 + the level of the warning wire, and bypassing it without setting it off usually requires a successful Acrobatics check at the same DC, though the GM might adjust the DC higher or lower as circumstances dictate. You can twist the cylinder in a preset pattern as a move action, deactivating the alarm and respooling the wire around the cylinder.",

    "name": "acclimation torc",
    "description": "This simple metal band attaches to the collar area of your space suit, suit of armor, or other set of clothes. When activated as a standard action, an acclimation torc places your respiratory system and your digestive system in a form of temporal stasis, while still keeping you alive. Essentially, your need to eat, drink, and breathe is temporarily “paused” while the acclimation torc continues to hold a charge. You can breathe normally in vacuums, clouds of smoke, water, and thick, thin, and toxic atmospheres, though you aren’t protected against the damage of a corrosive atmosphere. In addition, you don’t need to worry about starvation or thirst while your acclimation torc is active. Unlike the normal protections provided by most suits of armor, an acclimation torc doesn’t grant you protection against low levels of radiation or conditions of cold and heat. An acclimation torc holds 50 charges and uses 1 charge per hour. You can replenish these charges the same way you recharge the duration of a suit of armor’s environmental protections ( Starfinder Core Rulebook 198).",

    "name": "dimensional comm unit",
    "description": "These devices are handheld and circular in shape and have a very high-resolution screen and simple controls. Dimensional comm units are a kishalee version of the comm units commonly found in the Pact Worlds, but they function using the remnants of the vast demiplane network utilized by the now extinct kishalee civilization. The advantage of dimensional comm units is that their text and verbal communications are instantaneous, whether in the same system or through interstellar space, but because of the degraded state of the kishalee dimensional network, they work only sporadically. Prior to use, a dimensional comm unit must be linked with at least one other unit—a process that takes only a minute when all units to be linked are on the same planet. Dimensional comm units nearly always work when used on the same planet to reach other linked devices. Over greater distances, each time a dimensional comm is used, there is a 50% chance that it will function properly if used in the same system or a 25% chance if the communication is interstellar (this is rolled in secret by the GM), but only with linked dimensional comm units. If two linked dimensional comm units make a connection, they retain that connection for 24 hours. If the dimensional comm units don’t manage to connect, the users can try again after 24 hours. Dimensional comm units do not function within the Drift or on other planes.",

    "description": "A horizon shield slips over one hand much like a set of brass knuckles with a touch-sensitive control pad resting in your palm. Activating or deactivating a horizon shield is a move action. When activated, a horizon shield forms a nearly invisible barrier that warps space around you, making you more difficult to hit with ranged attacks. Any ranged attack targeting you treats you as if are 60 feet farther away than you actually are. This might impart a range increment penalty to the attack roll or even make the attack impossible altogether. You must be aware of the attacker and can’t be holding anything else in the hand equipped with the horizon shield. This effect doesn’t stack with effects from other horizon shields. A horizon shield has a capacity of 20 and uses 1 charge per round that it is active.",

    "name": "sovereign helm",
    "description": "This strange silvery helm features a glowing band of greenish energy. Four metal clasps attached to long, sharp appendages poke out from the crown of the helm. When the apparatus is held over the head of a Small or Medium living creature for 1 minute, the band of energy pulsates wildly, and at the end of that time, the clasps slap down and start to painlessly burrow into the creature’s cranium. After another full minute, the appendages become fully embedded, and the sovereign helm begins the 24-hour process of rewriting the neural pathways of the subject’s brain. If the helm is removed at any time during this period and then placed back onto the same subject, the 24 hours begin anew. Once this process is complete, the sovereign helm grants the wearer some control over constructs with the technological subtype. While a sovereign helm has a different method of installation than most augmentations, it acts as a brain system augmentation in all other ways. You can’t wear and make use of a sovereign helm if you have preexisting brain system implantation, nor can you install a brain system implantation while a sovereign helm’s apparatuses are burrowed into your cranium. Once the sovereign helm has fully rewritten your neural pathways, it allows you to spend a standard action in an attempt to assert some amount of control over a single construct with the technological subtype that you can see within 60 feet of you. A targeted construct must attempt a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your key ability score modifier); on a failure, it must stop what is doing and can do only what you command (using only the following commands) until the end of your next turn. If the construct succeeds at its saving throw, it is immune to your sovereign helm’s control for 24 hours. Full Stop : The construct cannot do anything until the end of your next turn. Move : On the construct’s next turn, you can decide how it spends its move action. Attack : On the construct’s next turn, you can decide how it attacks. After the first round a construct has failed its save, you can attempt to maintain your control over it with a move action each round, but the construct can attempt another saving throw. If the construct succeeds, you lose control and the construct is immune to your sovereign helm’s effects for 24 hours. If the construct fails, your control over it continues until the end of your next turn, and you can choose the same or a different command from the list. A sovereign helm allows you to control only one construct at a time.",
